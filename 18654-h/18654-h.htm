<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Harry Loudon Makes Up His Mind.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>On a wooden bench under a great catalpa-tree,
in the front yard of a comfortable
country-house in Virginia, sat Harry and Kate
Loudon worrying their minds. It was all about
old Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda was no relation of these children.
She was an old colored woman, who lived
in a cabin about a quarter of a mile from their
house, but they considered her one of their
best friends. Her old log cabin was their favorite
resort, and many a fine time they had there.
When they caught some fish, or Harry shot a
bird or two, or when they could get some sweet
potatoes or apples to roast, and some corn-meal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for ash-cakes, they would take their provisions
to Aunt Matilda and she would cook them.
Sometimes an ash-cake would be baked rather
harder than it was convenient to bite, and it had
happened that a fish or two had been cooked
entirely away, but such mishaps were not common.
Aunt Matilda was indeed a most wonderful
cook&mdash;and a cook, too, who liked to have
a boy and a girl by her while she was at work;
and who would tell them stories&mdash;as queer old
stories as ever were told&mdash;while the things were
cooking. The stories were really the cause of
the ash-cakes and fish sometimes being forgotten.</p>

<p>And it is no wonder that these children were
troubled in their minds. They had just heard
that Aunt Matilda was to go to the alms-house.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate were silent. They had
mourned over the news, and Kate had cried.
There was nothing more to be done about it, so
far as she could see.</p>

<p>But all of a sudden Harry jumped up. "I
tell you what it is Kate," he exclaimed; "I've
made up my mind! Aunt Matilda is not going
to the alms-house. I will support her myself!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that will be splendid!" cried Kate;
"but you can never do it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," said Harry. "There are ever
so many ways in which I can earn money."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" said Kate;
"will you let me help?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her brother; "you may help if
you can, but I don't think you will be of much
use. As for me, I shall do plenty of things.
I shall go out with my gun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there is nothing to shoot, now in the
summer-time," said Kate.</p>

<p>"No, there isn't much yet, to be sure," said
her brother, "but before very long there will be
partridges and hares, plenty of them; and father
and Captain Caseby will buy all I shoot. And
you see, until it is time for game I'm going
to gather sumac."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can help you in that," cried Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe you can," said her brother.
"And now, suppose we go down and see Aunt
Matilda, and have a talk with her about it."</p>

<p>"Just wait until I get my bonnet," said Kate.
And she dashed into the house, and then, with
a pink calico sun-bonnet on her head, she came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
down the steps in two jumps, and the brother
and sister, together, hurried through the woods
to Aunt Matilda's cabin.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate Loudon were well-educated
children, and, in many respects, knew more than
most girls and boys who were older than they.
Harry had been taught by his father to ride and
to swim and to shoot as carefully as his school-teacher
had taught him to spell and to parse.
And he was not only taught to be skillful in
these outdoor pursuits, but to be prudent, and
kind-hearted. When he went gunning, he shot
birds and game that were fit for the table; and
when he rode, he remembered that his horse had
feelings as well as himself. Being a boy of good
natural impulses, he might have found out these
things for himself; but, for fear that he might
be too long about it, his father carefully taught
him that it was possible to shoot and to hunt
and to ride without being either careless or cruel.
It must not be supposed that Harry was so extremely
particular that there was no fun in him,
for he had discovered that there is just as much
fun in doing things right as in doing them wrong;
and as there was not a boy in all the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
round about who could ride or swim or shoot
so well as Harry, so there was none who had a
more generally jolly time than he.</p>

<p>His sister Kate was a sharp, bright, intelligent
girl, rather inclined to be wild when opportunity
offered; but very affectionate, and always
as ready for outdoor sports as any boy. She
could not shoot&mdash;at least, she never tried&mdash;and
she did not ride much on horseback, but she
enjoyed fishing, and rambles through the woods
were to her a constant delight. When anything
was to be done, especially if it was anything
novel, Kate was always ready to help. If anybody
had a plan on hand, it was very hard to
keep her finger out of it; and if there were calculations
to be made, it was all the better. Kate
had a fine head for mathematics, and, on the
whole, she rather preferred a slate and pencil to
needles and spool-cotton.</p>

<p>As to Aunt Matilda, there could be no doubt
about her case being a pretty hard one. She
was quite old and decrepit when the war set
her free, and, at the time of our story, she was
still older and stiffer. Her former master had
gone to the North to live, and as she had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
family to support her, the poor old woman was
compelled to depend upon the charity of her
neighbors. For a time she managed to get along
tolerably well, but it was soon found that she
would suffer if she depended upon occasional
charity, especially after she became unable to go
after food or help. Mr. and Mrs. Loudon were
very willing to give her what they could, but
they had several poor people entirely dependent
upon them, and they found it impossible to add
to the number of their pensioners. So it was
finally determined among the neighbors that
Aunt Matilda would have to go to the alms-house,
which place was provided for just such
poor persons as she. Neither Harry nor Kate
knew much about the alms-house, but they
thought it must be some sort of a horrible place;
and, at any rate, it was too hard that Aunt Matilda
should have to leave her old home where
she had spent so many, many years.</p>

<p>And they did not intend she should do it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">The Adoption.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When the children reached Aunt Matilda's
cabin, they found the old woman
seated by a very small fire, which was burning
in one corner of the hearth.</p>

<p>"Are you cold, Aunt Matilda?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, no, honey! But you see
there wasn't hardly any coals left, and I was
tryin' to keep the fire alive till somebody would
come along and gather me up some wood."</p>

<p>"Then you were going to cook your breakfast,
I suppose," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, child, if somebody 'ud come along and
fetch me something to eat."</p>

<p>"Haven't you anything at all in the house?"
asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Not a pinch o' meal, nor nothin' else," said
the old woman; "but I 'spected somebody 'ud
be along."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you know, Aunt Matilda," said Harry,
"that they are going to send you to the alms-house?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I heerd 'em talk about it," said Aunt
Matilda, shaking her head; "but the alms-house
ain't no place for me."</p>

<p>"That's so!" said Kate, quickly. "And
you're not going there, either!"</p>

<p>"No," said Harry: "Kate and I intend to
take care of you for the rest of your life."</p>

<p>"Lor', children, you can't do it!" said the
old woman, looking in astonishment from one to
the other of these youngsters who proposed to
adopt her.</p>

<p>"Yes; but we can," said Harry. "Just you
wait and see."</p>

<p>"It'll take a good deal o' money," said the
old woman, who did not seem to be altogether
satisfied with the prospects held out before her.
"More'n you all will ever be able to git."</p>

<p>"How much money would be enough for you
to live on, Aunt Matilda?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Dunno. Takes a heap o' money to keep
a person."</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Kate, "let's see exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
how much it will take. Have you a pencil,
Harry? I have a piece of paper in my pocket, I
think. Yes; here it is. Now, let's set down
everything, and see what it comes to."</p>

<p>So saying, she sat down on a low stool with
her paper on her knees, and her pencil in her
hand.</p>

<p>"What shall we begin with?" said she.</p>

<p>"We'll begin with corn-meal," said Harry.
"How much corn-meal do you eat in a week,
Aunt Matilda?"</p>

<p>"Dunno," said she, "'spect about a couple
o' pecks."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Matilda!" cried Kate, "our
whole family wouldn't eat two pecks in a
week."</p>

<p>"Well, then, a half-peck," said she; "'pends
a good deal on how many is living in a house."</p>

<p>"Yes; but we only mean this for you, Aunt
Matilda. We don't mean it for anybody else."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I reckon a quarter of a peck
would do, for jest me."</p>

<p>"We will allow you a peck," said Harry,
"and that will be twenty-five cents a week. Set
that down, Kate."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said Kate. And she set down
at the top of the paper, "Meal, 25 cents."</p>

<p>The children proceeded in this way to calculate
how much bacon, molasses, coffee, and sugar
would suffice for Aunt Matilda's support; and
they found that the cost, per week, at the rates
of the country stores, with which they were both
familiar, would be seventy-seven and three-quarter
cents.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else, Aunt Matilda?"
asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Nuffin I can think on," said Aunt Matilda,
"'cept milk."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can get that for nothing," said Kate.
"I will bring it to you from home; and I will
bring you some butter too, when I can get it."</p>

<p>"And I'll pick up wood for you," said Harry.
"I can gather enough in the woods in a couple
of hours to last you for a week."</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, chil'en," said Aunt Matilda,
"I hope you'll be able to do all dat."</p>

<p>Harry stood quiet a few minutes, reflecting.</p>

<p>"How much would seventy-seven and three
quarter cents a week amount to in a year, Kate?"
said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate rapidly worked out the problem, and
answered: "Forty dollars and forty-three cents."</p>

<p>"Lor'! but that's a heap o' money!" said
Aunt Matilda. "That's more'n I 'spect to have
all the rest of my life."</p>

<p>"How old are you, Aunt Matilda?" said
Harry.</p>

<p>"I 'spect about fifty," said the old woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Matilda!" cried Harry, "you're
certainly more than fifty. When I was a very
little fellow, I remember that you were very old&mdash;at
least, sixty or seventy."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I 'spects I'se about ninety,"
said Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>"But you can't be ninety!" said Kate. "The
Bible says that seventy years is the common
length of a person's life."</p>

<p>"Them was Jews," said Aunt Matilda. "It
didn't mean no cull'd people. Cull'd people
live longer than that. But p'raps a cull'd Jew
wouldn't live very long."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry, "it makes no difference
how old you are. We're going to take care of
you for the rest of your life."</p>

<p>Kate was again busy with her paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"In five years, Harry," she said, "It will be
two hundred and two dollars and fifteen cents."</p>

<p>"Lor'!" cried Aunt Matilda, "you chil'en
will nebber git dat."</p>

<p>"But we don't have to get it all at once,
Aunt Matilda," said Harry, laughing; "and you
needn't be afraid that we can't do it. Come,
Kate, it's time for us to be off."</p>

<p>And then the conference broke up. The
question of Aunt Matilda's future support was
settled. They had forgotten clothes, to be sure;
but it is very difficult to remember everything.</p>

put together what little money they had,
and found that they could buy food enough to
last Aunt Matilda for several days. This Harry
procured and carried down to the old woman
that day. He also gathered and piled up inside
of her cabin a good supply of wood. Fortunately,
there was a spring very near her door, so
that she could get water without much trouble.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate determined that they would
commence business in earnest the next morning,
and, as this was not the season for game, they
determined to go to work to gather sumac-leaves.</p>

<p>Most of us are familiar with the sumac-bush,
which grows nearly all over the United States.
Of course we do not mean the poisonous swamp-sumac,
but that which grows along the fences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and on the edges of the woods. Of late years
the leaves of this bush have been greatly in
demand for tanning purposes, and, in some
States, especially in Virginia, sumac gathering
has become a very important branch of industry,
particularly with the negroes; many of whom,
during the sumac season, prefer gathering these
leaves to doing any other kind of work. The
sumac-bush is quite low, and the leaves are
easily stripped off. They are then carefully
dried, and packed in bags, and carried to the
nearest place of sale, generally a country store.</p>

<p>The next morning, Harry and Kate made
preparations for a regular expedition. They
were to take their dinner, and stay all day.
Kate was enraptured&mdash;even more so, perhaps,
than Harry. Each of them had a large bag, and
Harry carried his gun, for who could tell what
they might meet with? A mink, perhaps, or a
fox, or even a beaver! They had a long walk,
but it was through the woods, and there was
always something to see in the woods. In a
couple of hours, for they stopped very often,
they reached a little valley, through which ran
Crooked Creek. And on the banks of Crooked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Creek were plenty of sumac-bushes. This place
was at some distance from any settlement, and
apparently had not been visited by sumac
gatherers.</p>

<p>"Hurra!" cried Kate, "here is enough to
fill a thousand bags!"</p>

<p>Harry leaned his gun against a tree, and
hung up his shot and powder flasks, and they
both went to work gathering sumac. There was
plenty of it, but Kate soon found that what
they saw would not fill a thousand bags. There
were a good many bushes, but they were small;
and, when all the leaves were stripped off one,
and squeezed into a bag, they did not make a
very great show. However, they did very well,
and, for an hour or so, they worked on merrily.
Then they had dinner. Harry built a fire. He
easily found dry branches, and he had brought
matches and paper with him. At a little distance
under a great pine-tree, Kate selected a
level place, and cleared away the dead leaves
and the twigs, leaving a smooth table of dry and
fragrant pine-needles. On this she spread the
cloth, which was a napkin. Then she took from
the little basket she had brought with her a cake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of corn-meal, several thick and well-buttered
slices of wheat bread, some hard-boiled eggs, a
little paper of pepper and salt, a piece of cheese,
and some fried chicken. When this was spread
out (and it would not all go on the cloth),
Harry came, and looked at the repast.</p>

<p>"What is there to cook?" said he.</p>

<p>Kate glanced over her table, with a perplexed
look upon her countenance, and said, "I don't
believe there is anything to cook."</p>

<p>"But we ought to cook something," said
Harry. "Here is a splendid fire. What's the
good of camping out if you don't cook things?"</p>

<p>"But everything is cooked," said Kate.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said Harry, in a somewhat
discouraged tone. Had he built that beautiful
fire for nothing? "We ought to have brought
along something raw," said he. "It is ridiculous
eating a cold dinner, with a splendid fire like
that."</p>

<p>"We might catch some fish," said Kate; "we
should have to cook <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harry, "but I brought no
lines."</p>

<p>So, as there was nothing else to be done,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
they ate their dinner cold, and when they had
finished, Kate cleared off the table by giving the
napkin a flirt, and they were ready for work
again. But first they went to look for a spring,
where they could get a drink. In about half an
hour they found a spring, and some wild plums,
and some blackberries, and a grape-vine (which
would surely be full of grapes in the fall, and
was therefore a vine to be remembered), and a
stone, which Kate was quite certain was an
Indian arrow-head, and some tracks in the white
sand, which must have been made by some
animal or other, although neither of them was
able to determine exactly what animal.</p>

<p>When they returned to the pine-tree, Kate
took up her bag. Harry followed her example,
but somewhat slowly, as if he were thinking of
something else.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Harry," said Kate, "suppose
you take your gun and go along the creek and
see what that was that made the tracks. If it
was anything with fur on it, it would come to
more than the sumac. I will stay here, and go
on filling my bag."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry, after a moment's hesitation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
"I might go a little way up the creek. I
needn't be gone long. I would certainly like to
find that creature, if I can."</p>

<p>"All right," said Kate; "I think you'll find
it."</p>

<p>So Harry loaded his gun, and hurried off to
find the tracks of the mysterious, and probably
fur-covered animal.</p>

<p>Kate worked away cheerfully, singing a little
song, and filling her bag with the sumac-leaves.
It was now much warmer, and she began to find
that sumac picking, all alone, was not very interesting,
and she hoped that Harry would soon
find his animal, whatever it was. Then, after
picking a little longer, she thought she would
sit down, and rest awhile. So she dragged her
bag to the pine-tree, and sat down, leaning her
back against the tall trunk. She took her bag
of sumac in her arms, and lifted it up, trying to
estimate its weight.</p>

<p>"There must be ten pounds here!" she said,
"No&mdash;it don't feel very heavy, but then there
are so many of the leaves. It ought to weigh
fifteen pounds. And they will be a cent a pound
if we take pay in trade, and three-quarters of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
cent if we want cash. But, of course, we will
take things in trade."</p>

<p>And then she put down the bag, and began
to calculate.</p>

<p>"Fifteen pounds, fifteen cents, and at seventy-seven
and three-quarter cents per week, that
would support Aunt Matilda nearly a day and a
half; and then, if Harry has as much more, that
will keep her almost three days; and if we pick
for two hours longer, when Harry comes back,
we may get ten pounds more apiece, which will
make it pretty heavy; but then we won't have
to come again for nearly five days; and if Harry
shoots an otter, I reckon he can get a dollar for
the skin&mdash;or a pair of gloves of it&mdash;kid gloves,
and my pink dress&mdash;and we'll go in the carriage&mdash;two
horses&mdash;four horses&mdash;a prince with
a feather&mdash;some butterflies&mdash;" and Kate was
asleep.</p>

<p>When Kate awoke, she saw by the sun that
she had been asleep for several hours. She
sprang to her feet. "Where is Harry?" she
cried. But nobody answered. Then she was
frightened, for he might be lost. But soon she
reflected that that was very ridiculous, for neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of them could be lost in that neighborhood
which they knew so well. Then she sat down and
waited, quite anxiously, it must be admitted.
But Harry did not come, and the sun sank lower.
Presently she rose with an air of determination.</p>

<p>"I can't wait any longer," she said, "or it
will be dark before I get home. Harry has followed
that thing up the creek ever so far, and
there is no knowing when he will get back, and
it won't do for me to stay here. I'll go home,
and leave a note for him."</p>

<p>She put her hand in her pocket, and there
was Harry's pencil, which she had borrowed in
the morning and forgot to return, and also the
piece of paper on which she had made her calculation
of the cost of Aunt Matilda's board.
The back of this would do very well for a note.
So she wrote on it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am going home, for it is getting late. I shall go back
by the same road we came. Your sumac-bag is in the bushes
between the tree and the creek. Bring this piece of paper with
you, as it has Aunt Matilda's expenses on the outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate</span>.</p></div>

<p>This note she pinned up against the pine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
tree, where Harry could not fail to see it. Then
she hid her brother's sumac-bag in the bushes
and, shouldering her own bag, which, by-the-way,
did not weigh so many pounds as she
thought it did, set out for home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Kate, very naturally, is Anxious.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Kate hurried through the woods, for she
was afraid she would not reach home until
after dark, and indeed it was then quite like twilight
in the shade of the great trees around her.
The road on which she was walking was, however,
clear and open, and she was certain she
knew the way. As she hastened on, she could
not help feeling that she was wasting this delightful
walk through the woods. Her old friends
were around her, and though she knew them all
so well, she could not stop to spend any time
with them. There were the oaks&mdash;the black-oak
with its shining many-pointed leaves, the
white-oak with its lighter green though duller-hued
foliage, and the chestnut-oak with its long
and thickly clustered leaves. Then there were
the sweet-gums, fragrant and star-leaved, and
the black-gum, tough, dark, and unpretending.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
No little girl in the county knew more about the
trees of her native place than Kate; for she had
made good use of her long rides through the
country with her father. Here were the chincapin-bushes,
like miniature chestnut-trees, and
here were the beautiful poplars. She knew them
by their bright leaves, which looked as though
they had been snipped off at the top with a pair
of scissors. And here, right in front of her, was
Uncle Braddock. She knew him by his many-colored
dressing-gown, without which he never
appeared in public. It was one of the most
curious dressing-gowns ever seen, as Uncle Braddock
was one of the most curious old colored
men ever seen. The gown was not really as old
as its wearer, but it looked older. It was composed
of about a hundred pieces of different
colors and patterns&mdash;red, green, blue, yellow, and
brown; striped, spotted, plain, and figured with
flowers and vines. These pieces, from year to
year, had been put on as patches, and some of
them were quilted on, and some were sewed, and
some were pinned. The gown was very long
and came down to Uncle Braddock's heels, which
were also very long and bobbed out under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
bottom of the gown as if they were trying to
kick backward. But Uncle Braddock never
kicked. He was very old and he had all the
different kinds of rheumatism, and walked bent
over nearly at right-angles, supporting himself
by a long cane like a bean-pole, which he grasped
in the middle. There was probably no particular
reason why he should bend over so very
much, but he seemed to like to walk in that way,
and nobody objected. He was a good old soul,
and Kate was delighted to see him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Braddock!" she cried.</p>

<p>The old man stopped and turned around,
almost standing up straight in his astonishment
at seeing the young girl alone in the woods.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Kate!" he exclaimed, as she
came up with him, "what in the world is you
doin' h'yar?"</p>

<p>"I've been gathering sumac," said Kate, as
they walked on together, "and Harry's gone off,
and I couldn't wait any longer and I'm just as
glad as I can be to see you, Uncle Braddock, for
I was beginning to be afraid, because its getting
dark so fast, and your dressing-gown looked
prettier to me than all the trees when I first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
caught sight of it. But I think you ought to
have it washed, Uncle Braddock."</p>

<p>"Wash him!" said Uncle Braddock, with a
chuckle, as if the suggestion was a very funny
joke; "dat wouldn't do, no how. He'd wash
all to bits, and the pins would stick 'em in the
hands. Couldn't wash him, Miss Kate; it's too
late for dat now. Might have washed him before
de war, p'raps. We was stronger, den.
But what you getherin sumac for, Miss Kate?
If you white folks goes pickin it all, there won't
be none lef' soon fur de cull'ed people, dat's
mighty certain."</p>

<p>"Why, I'm picking it for the colored people,"
said Kate, "at least for one colored person."</p>

<p>"Why don't you let 'em pick it the'rselves?"
asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Because Aunt Matilda can't do it," said
Kate.</p>

<p>"Is dat sumac fur Aunt Matilda?" said
Uncle Braddock.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Kate, "and Harry's been
gathering some, and we're going to pick enough
to get her all she wants. Harry and I intend to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
take care of her now. You know they were
going to send her to the alms-house."</p>

<p>"Well, I declar!" exclaimed the old man.
"I neber did hear de like o' dat afore. Why,
you all isn't done bein' tuk care of you'selves."
Kate laughed, and explained their plans, getting
quite enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>"Lem me carry dat bag," said Uncle Braddock.
"Oh no!" said Kate, "you're too old to
be carrying bags."</p>

<p>"Jis lem me hab it," said he; "it's trouble
enuf fur me to get along, anyway, and a bag or
two don't make no kind o' dif'rence."</p>

<p>Kate found herself obliged to consent, and as
the bag was beginning to feel very heavy for her,
and as it did not seem to make the slightest difference,
as he had said, to Uncle Braddock, she
was very glad to be rid of it.</p>

<p>But when at last they reached the village,
and Uncle Braddock went over the fields to his
cabin, Kate ran into the house, carrying her bag
with ease, for she was excited by the hope that
Harry had come home by some shorter way,
and that she should find him in the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was no Harry there. And soon it
was night, and yet he did not come.</p>

<p>Matters now looked serious, and about nine
o'clock Mr. Loudon, with two of the neighbors,
started out into the woods to look for Aunt
Matilda's young guardian.</p>

<p>Kate's mother was away on a visit to her
relations in another county, and so the little
girl passed the night on the sofa in the parlor,
with a colored woman asleep on the rug before
the fireplace. Kate would not go to bed. She
determined to stay awake until Harry should
come home. But the sofa-cushions became
more and more pleasant, and very soon she was
dreaming that Harry had shot a giraffe, and had
skinned it, and had stuffed the skin full of sumac-leaves,
and that he and she were pulling it
through the woods, and that the legs caught in
the trees and they could not get it along, and
then she woke up. It was bright daylight.
But Harry had not come!</p>

<p>There was no news. Mr. Loudon and his
friends were still absent. Poor Kate was in despair,
and could not touch the breakfast, which
was prepared at the usual hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>About nine o'clock a company of negro
sumac gatherers appeared on the road which
passed Mr. Loudon's house. It was a curious
party. On a rude cart, drawn by two little oxen,
was a pile of bags filled with sumac-leaves, which
were supported by poles stuck around the cart
and bound together by ropes. On the top of
the pile sat a negro, plying a long whip and
shouting to the oxen. Behind the cart, and on
each side of it, were negroes, men and women,
carrying huge bales of sumac on their heads.
Bags, pillow-cases, bed-ticks, sheets and coverlets
had been called into requisition to hold
the precious leaves. Here was a woman with a
great bundle on her head, which sank down so
as to almost entirely conceal her face; and near
her was an old man who supported on his bare
head a load that looked heavy enough for a horse.
Even little children carried bundles considerably
larger than themselves, and all were laughing
and talking merrily as they made their way to
the village store at the cross-roads.</p>

<p>Kate ran eagerly out to question these
people. They must certainly have seen Harry.</p>

<p>The good-natured negroes readily stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to talk with Kate. The ox-driver halted his
team, and every head-burdened man, woman,
and child clustered around her, until it seemed
as if sumac clouds had spread between her and
the sky, and had obscured the sun.</p>

<p>But no one had seen Harry. In fact, this
company, with the accumulated proceeds of a
week's sumac gathering, had come from a portion
of the county many miles from Crooked
Creek, and of course, they could bring no news
to Kate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">The Turkey-Hunter.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When Harry left Kate, he quietly walked
by the side of Crooked Creek, keeping his
eyes fixed on the tracks of the strange animal,
and his thumb on the hammer of the right-hand
barrel of his gun. Before long the tracks disappeared,
and disappeared, too, directly in front
of a hole in the bank; quite a large hole, big
enough for a beaver or an otter. This was capital
luck! Harry got down on his hands and
knees and examined the tracks. Sure enough,
the toes pointed toward the hole. It must be
in there!</p>

<p>Harry cocked his gun and sat and waited.
He was as still as a dead mouse. There was no
earthly reason why the creature should not come
out, except perhaps that it might not want to
come out. At any rate, it could not know that
Harry was outside waiting for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited a long time without ever thinking
how the day was passing on; and it began to be
a little darkish, just a little, before he thought
that perhaps he had better go back to Kate.</p>

<p>But it might be just coming out, and what a
shame to move! A skin that would bring five
dollars was surely worth waiting for a little
while longer, and he might never have such
another chance. He certainly had never had
such a one before.</p>

<p>And so he still sat and waited, and pretty
soon he heard something. But it was not in the
hole&mdash;not near him at all. It was farther along
the creek, and sounded like the footsteps of
some one walking stealthily.</p>

<p>Harry looked around quickly, and, about
thirty yards from him, he saw a man with a gun.
The man was now standing still, looking steadily
at him. At least Harry thought he was, but
there was so little light in the woods by this time
that he could not be sure about it. What was
that man after? Could he be watching him?</p>

<p>Harry was afraid to move. Perhaps the man
mistook him for some kind of an animal. To be
sure, he could not help thinking that boys were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
animals, but he did not suppose the man would
want to shoot a boy, if he knew it. But how
could any one tell that Harry was a boy at that
distance, and in that light.</p>

<p>Poor Harry did not even dare to call out.
He could not speak without moving something,
his lips any way, and the man might fire at the
slightest motion. He was so quiet that the
musk-rat&mdash;it was a musk-rat that lived in the
hole&mdash;came out of his house, and seeing the
boy so still, supposed he was nothing of any consequence,
and so trotted noiselessly along to the
water and slipped in for a swim. Harry never
saw him. His eyes were fixed on the man.</p>

<p>For some minutes longer&mdash;they seemed like
hours&mdash;he remained motionless. And then he
could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>"Hel-low!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Hel-low!" said the man.</p>

<p>Then Harry got up trembling and pale, and
the man came toward him.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't know what you were," said
the man.</p>

<p>"Tony Kirk!" exclaimed Harry. Yes, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
was Tony Kirk, sure enough, a man who would
never shoot a boy&mdash;if he knew it.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here," asked Tony,
"a-squattin' in the dirt at supper-time?"</p>

<p>Harry told him what he was doing, and how
he had been frightened, and then the remark
about supper-time made him think of his sister.
"My senses!" he cried, "there's Kate! she
must think I'm lost."</p>

<p>"Kate!" exclaimed Tony. "What Kate?
You don't mean your sister!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Harry; and away he ran
down the shore of the creek. Tony followed,
and when he reached the big pine-tree, there
was Harry gazing blankly around him.</p>

<p>"She's gone!" faltered the boy.</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Tony, "if she knew
what was good for her. What's this?" His
quick eyes had discovered the paper on the
tree.</p>

<p>Tony pulled the paper from the pine trunk
and tried to read it, but Harry was at his side in
an instant, and saw it was Kate's writing. It
was almost too dark to read it, but he managed,
by holding it toward the west, to make it out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's gone home," he said, "and I must be
after her;" and he prepared to start.</p>

<p>"Hold up!" cried Tony; "I'm going that
way. And so you've been getherin' sumac."
Harry had read the paper aloud. "There's no
use o' leavin' yer bag. Git it out o' the bushes,
and come along with me."</p>

<p>Harry soon found his bag, and then he and
Tony set out along the road.</p>

<p>"What are you after?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Turkeys," said Tony.</p>

<p>Tony Kirk was always after turkeys. He
was a wild-turkey hunter by profession. It is
true there were seasons of the year when he did
not shoot turkeys, but although at such times he
worked a little at farming and fished a little, he
nearly always found it necessary to do something
that related to turkeys. He watched
their haunts, he calculated their increase, he
worked out problems which proved to him
where he would find them most plentiful in the
fall, and his mind was seldom free from the consideration
of the turkey question.</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather early for turkeys?" asked
Harry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Tony, "but I'm tired o'
waitin."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to make a short cut," continued
Tony, striking out of the road into a narrow path
in the woods. "You can save half a mile by
comin' this way."</p>

<p>So Harry followed him.</p>

<p>"I don't mind takin' you," said Tony, "fur
I know you kin keep a secret. My turkey-blind
is over yander;" and as he said this he put his
hand into his coat pocket and pulled out a handful
of shelled corn, which he began to scatter
along the path, a grain or two at a time. After
ten or fifteen minutes' walking, Tony scattering
corn all the way, they came to a mass of oak
and chestnut boughs, piled up on one side of
the path like a barrier. This was the turkey-blind.
It was four or five feet high, and behind
it Tony was accustomed to sit in the early gray
of the morning, waiting for the turkeys which
he hoped to entice that way by means of his
long line of shelled corn.</p>

<p>"You see I build my blind," said he to
Harry, "and then I don't come here till I've
sprinkled my corn for about a week, and got the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
turkeys used to comin' this way after it. Then
I get back o' that thar at night and wait till the
airly mornin', when they're sartin to come gobblin'
along, till I can get a good crack at 'em."
With this he sat down on a log, which Harry
could scarcely see, so dark was it in the woods
by this time.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"No," answered Tony; "I'm goin' to stop
here. I want to be ready fur 'em before it
begins to be light."</p>

<p>"But how am I to get home?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, jist keep straight on in that track. It'll
take yer straight to the store, ef ye don't turn
out uv it."</p>

<p>"Can't you come along and show me?" said
Harry. "I can't find the way through these
dark woods."</p>

<p>"It's easy enough," said Tony, striking a
match to light his pipe. "I could find my way
with my eyes shut. And it would not do fur
me to go. I'll make too much noise comin'
back. There's no knowin' how soon the turkeys
will begin to stir about."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you oughtn't to have brought me
here," said Harry, much provoked.</p>

<p>"I wanted to show you a short way home,"
said Tony, puffing away at his pipe.</p>

<p>Harry answered not a word, but set out
along the path. In a minute or two he ran
against a tree; then he turned to the right and
stumbled over a root, dropping his bag and
nearly losing his hold of his gun. He was soon
convinced that it was all nonsense to try to get
home by that path, and he slowly made his way
back to Tony.</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye what it is," said the turkey-hunter,
"ef you think you'd hurt yerself findin' yer
way home, and I thought you knew the woods
better than that, you might as well stay here
with me. I'll take you home bright an' airly. You
needn't trouble yerself about yer sister. She's
home long ago. It must have been bright daylight
when she wrote on that paper, and she
could keep the road easy enough."</p>

<p>Harry said nothing, but sat down on the
other end of the log. Tony did not seem to
notice his vexation, but talked to him, explaining
the mysteries of turkey-hunting and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
delight of spending a night in the woods, where
everything was so cool and dry and still.
"There's no nonsense here," said Tony. "Ef
there's any place where a feller kin have peace
and comfert, it's in the woods, at night."</p>

<p>By degrees Harry became interested and forgot
his annoyance. Kate was certainly safe at
home, and as it was impossible for him to find his
way out of the depths of the woods, he might
as well be content. He could not even hope to
regain the road by the way they came.</p>

<p>When Tony had finished his pipe he took
Harry behind his blind. "All you have to do,"
said he, "is jist to peep over here and level
your gun along that path, keepin' yer eye fixed
straight in front of you, and after awhile you can
begin to see things. Suppose that dark lump
down yander was a turkey. Just look at it long
enough and you kin make it out. You see what
I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harry, peeping over the blind;
"I see it;" and then, with a sudden jump, he
whispered, "Tony! it's moving." Tony did
not answer for a moment, and then he hurriedly
whispered back, "That's so! It <i>is</i> moving."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Tony Strikes Out.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was no doubt about it, something
<i>was</i> moving. There was a rise in the
ground a short distance in front of the turkey-blind,
and a little patch of dark sky was visible
between the trees. Across this bit of sky something
dark was slowly passing.</p>

<p>"Ye kin see 'most anything in the darkest
night," whispered Tony, "ef ye kin only git the
sky behind it. But that's no turkey."</p>

<p>"What do you think it is?" said Harry,
softly. "It's big enough for a turkey."</p>

<p>"Too big," said Tony. "Let's git after it.
You slip along the path, and I'll go round ahead
of it. Feel yer way, and don't make no noise if
ye run agin anything. And mind this"&mdash;and
here Tony spoke in one of the most impressive
of whispers&mdash;"don't you fire till yer <i>dead certain</i>
what it is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>With this Tony slipped away into the darkness,
and Harry, grasping his gun, set out to feel
his way. He felt his way along the path for a
short time, and then he felt his way out of it.
Then he crept into a low, soft place, full of ferns,
and out of that he carefully felt his way into a
big bush, where he knocked off his hat. When
he found his hat, which took him some time, he
gradually worked himself out into a place where
the woods were a little more open, and there he
caught another glimpse of the sky just at the
top of the ridge. There was something dark
against the sky, and Harry watched it for a long
time. At last, as it did not move at all, he came
to the conclusion that it must be a bush, and he
was entirely correct. For an hour or two he
quietly crept among the trees, hoping he would
either find the thing that was moving or get
back to the turkey-blind. Several times something
that he was sure was an "old har," as
hares are often called in Virginia, rushed out of
the bushes near him; and once he heard a quick
rustling among the dead leaves that sounded as
if it were made by a black snake, but it might as
well have been a Chinese pagoda on wheels, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
all he could see of it. At last he became very
tired, and sat down to rest with his back against
a big tree. There he soon began to nod, and,
without the slightest intention of doing anything
of the kind, he went to sleep just as soundly as
if he had been in his bed at home. And this
was not at all surprising, considering the amount
of walking and creeping that he had done that
day and night.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was daylight. He sprang
to his feet and found he was very stiff in the
legs, but that did not prevent him from running
this way and that to try and find some place in
the woods with which he was familiar. Before
long he heard what he thought was something
splashing in water, and, making his way toward
the sound, he pushed out on the bank of Crooked
Creek.</p>

<p>The creek was quite wide at this point, and
out near the middle of it he saw Tony's head.
The turkey-hunter was swimming hand-overhand,
"dog-fashion," for the shore. Behind him
was a boat, upside-down, which seemed just on
the point of sinking out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hel-low, there!" cried Harry; "what's the
matter, Tony?"</p>

<p>Tony never answered a word, but spluttered
and puffed, and struck out slowly but vigorously
for the bank.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," cried Harry, wildly excited,
"I'll reach you a pole."</p>

<p>But Tony did not wait, and Harry could find
no pole. When he turned around from his hurried
search among the bushes, the turkey-hunter
had found bottom, and was standing with his
head out of water. But the bottom was soft and
muddy, and he flopped about dolefully when he
attempted to walk to the bank. Harry reached
his gun out toward him, but Tony, with a quick
jerk of his arm, motioned it away.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be drownded than shot," he spluttered.
"I don't want no gun-muzzles pinted at
me. Take a-hold of that little tree, and then
reach me your hand."</p>

<p>Harry seized a young tree that grew on the
very edge of the bank, and as soon as Tony
managed to flop himself near enough, Harry
leaned over and took hold of his outstretched
hand and gave him a jerk forward with all his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
strength. Over went Tony, splash on his face
in the water, and Harry came very near going in
head-foremost on top of him. But he recovered
himself, and, not having loosed his grip of
Tony's hand, he succeeded, with a mighty effort,
in dragging the turkey-hunter's head out of the
water; and, after a desperate struggle with the
mud, Tony managed to get on his feet again.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he, blowing the water
out of his mouth and shaking his dripping head,
"but what I'd 'most as lieve be shot as ducked
that way. Don't you jerk so hard again. Hold
steady, and let me pull."</p>

<p>Harry took a still firmer grasp of the tree
and "held steady," while Tony gradually
worked his feet through the sticky mud until
he reached the bank, and then he laboriously
clambered on shore.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" said Harry. "How
did you get in the water?"</p>

<p>"Boat upsot," said Tony, seating himself, all
dripping with water and mud, upon the bank.</p>

<p>"Why, you came near being drowned," said
Harry, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No I didn't," answered Tony, pulling a big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
bunch of weeds and rubbing his legs with them
"I kin swim well enough, but a fellar has a
rough time in the water with big boots on and
his pockets full o' buck-shot."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you empty the shot out?" asked
Harry.</p>

<p>"And lose it all?" asked Tony, with an
aggrieved expression upon his watery face.</p>

<p>"But how did it happen?" Harry earnestly
inquired. "What were you doing in the boat?"</p>

<p>Tony did not immediately answer. He
rubbed at his legs, and then he tried to wipe his
face with his wet coat-sleeve, but finding that
only made matters worse, he accepted Harry's
offer of his handkerchief, and soon got his countenance
into talking order.</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said he, "I kept on up the
creek till I got opposite John Walker's cabin,
where it's narrow, and there's a big tree a-lyin'
across&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still following that thing?" interrupted
Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tony; "an' then I got over on
the tree and kep' down the creek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still following?" asked Harry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and I got a long ways down, and had
one bad tumble, too, in a dirty little gully; and
it was pretty nigh day when I turned to come
back. An' then when I got up here I thought I
would look fur John Walker's boat&mdash;fur I knew
he kept it tied up somewhere down this way&mdash;and
save myself all that walk. I found the ole
boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And how did it upset?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Tony; "easy enough. I
hadn't nuthin to row with but a bit o' pole, and
I got a sorter cross a-gettin' along so slow, and
so I stood up and gin a big push, and one foot
slipped, an' over she went."</p>

<p>"And in you went!" said Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in I went. I don't see what ever put
John Walker up to makin' sich a boat as that.
It's jist the meanest, lopsidedest, low-borndedst
boat I ever did see."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you think so," said Harry,
laughing; "but if I were you, I'd go home as
soon as I could, and get some dry clothes."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Tony, rising; "these feel
like the inside of an eelskin."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tony!" said Harry as they walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
along up the creek, "did you find out what that
thing was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," answered Tony.</p>

<p>"And what was it?"</p>

<p>"It was Captain Caseby."</p>

<p>"Captain Caseby?" cried Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes; jist him, and nuthin' else. It was his
head we seen agin the sky, as he was a-walkin'
on the other side of that little ridge."</p>

<p>"Captain Caseby!" again ejaculated Harry
in his amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Tony; "an' I'm glad I
found it out before I crossed the creek, for my
gun wasn't no further use, an' it was only in my
way, so I left it in the bushes up here. Ef it
hadn't been for that, the ole rifle would ha' been
at the bottom of the creek."</p>

<p>"But what was Captain Caseby doing here
in the woods at night?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Dunno," said Tony; "I jist follered him
till I made sure he wasn't a-huntin for my turkey-blind,
and then I let him go long. His
business wasn't no consarn o' mine."</p>

<p>When Tony and Harry had nearly reached
the village, who should they meet, at a cross-road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
in the woods, but Mr. Loudon and Captain
Caseby!</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried the captain "where on
earth have you been? Here I've been a-hunting
you all night."</p>

<p>"You have, have you?" said Tony, with a
chuckle; "and Harry and I've been a-huntin'
you all night, too."</p>

<p>Everybody now began to talk at once.
Harry's father was so delighted to find his boy
again, that he did not care to explain anything,
and he and Harry walked off together.</p>

<p>But Captain Caseby told Tony all about it.
How he, Mr. Loudon, and old Mr. Wagner, had
set out to look for Harry; how Mr. Wagner soon
became so tired that he had to give up, and go
home, and how Mr. Loudon had gone through
the woods to the north, while he kept down by
the creek, searching on both sides of the stream,
and how they had both walked, and walked, and
walked all night, and had met at last down by
the river.</p>

<p>"How did you manage to meet Mr. Loudon?"
asked Tony.</p>

<p>"I heard him hollerin'," said the captain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"He hollered pretty near all night, he told
me."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you holler?" Tony asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, I never exercise my voice in the night
air,' said the captain. "It's against my rules."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better break your rules next
time you go out in the woods where Harry is,"
said the turkey-hunter, "or he'll pop you over
for a turkey or a musk-rat. He's a sharp shot, I
kin tell ye."</p>

<p>"You don't really mean he was after me last
night with a gun!" exclaimed Captain Caseby.</p>

<p>"He truly was," declared Tony; "he was
a-trackin' you his Sunday best. It was bad for
you that it was so dark that he couldn't see
what you was; but it might have been worse for
ye if it hadn't been so dark that he couldn't find
ye at all."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I didn't know it," said the captain
earnestly; "thoroughly and completely glad I
didn't know it. I should have yelled all the skin
off my throat, if I'd have known he was after me
with a gun."</p>

<p>After Harry had been home an hour or two,
and Kate had somewhat recovered from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
transports of joy, and everybody in the village
had heard all about everything that had happened,
and Captain Caseby had declared, in the
bosom of his family, that he would never go out
into the woods again at night without keeping up
a steady "holler," Harry remembered that he had
left his sumac-bag somewhere in the woods.
Hard work for a whole day and a night, and
nothing to show for it! Rather a poor prospect
for Aunt Matilda.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Aunt Matilda's Christmas.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When Harry and Kate held council that
afternoon, their affairs looked a little discouraging.
Kate's sumac was weighed, and it
was only seven pounds! Seven whole cents, if
they took it out in trade, or five and a quarter
cents, as Kate calculated, if they took cash. A
woman as large as Aunt Matilda could not be
supported on that kind of an income, it was plain
enough.</p>

<p>But our brave boy and girl were not discouraged.
Harry went after his bag the next
day, and found it with about ten pounds of leaves
in it. Then, for a week or two, he and his sister
worked hard and sometimes gathered as much as
twenty-five pounds of leaves in a day. But they
had their bad days, when there was a great deal
of walking and very little picking.</p>

<p>And then, in due course of time, school began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and the sumac season was at an end, for the
leaves are not merchantable after they begin to
turn red, although they are then a great deal
prettier to look at.</p>

<p>But then Harry went out early in the morning,
and on Saturdays, and shot hares and partridges,
and Kate began to sell her chickens, of
which she had twenty-seven (eighteen died natural
deaths, or were killed by weasels during the
summer), they found that they made more
money than they could have made by sumac
gathering.</p>

<p>"It's a good deal for you two to do for that
old woman," said Captain Caseby, one day.</p>

<p>"But, didn't we promise to do it?" said
Miss Kate, bravely. "We'd do twice as much,
if there were two of her."</p>

<p>It was very fortunate, however, that there
were not two of her.</p>

<p>Sometimes they had extraordinary luck.
Early one November morning Harry was out in
the woods and caught sight of a fat wild-turkey.</p>

<p>Bang!&mdash;one dollar.</p>

<p>That was enough to keep Aunt Matilda for
a week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>At least it ought to have kept her. But
there was something wrong somewhere. Every
week it cost more and more to keep the old
colored woman in what Harry called "eating
material."</p>

<p>"Her appetite must be increasing," said
Harry; "she's eaten two pecks of meal this
week."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Kate; "she
couldn't do it. I believe she has company."</p>

<p>And this turned out to be true.</p>

<p>On inquiry they found that Uncle Braddock
was in the habit of taking his meals with Aunt
Matilda, sometimes three times a day. Now,
Uncle Braddock had a home of his own, where
he could get his meals if he chose to go after
them, and Harry remonstrated with him on
his conduct.</p>

<p>"Why, ye see, Mah'sr Harry," said the old
man, "she's so drefful lonesome down dar all by
sheself, and sometimes it's a-rainin' an' a long
way fur me to go home and git me wrapper all
wet jist fur one little meal o' wittles. And when
I see what you all is a-doin' fur her, I feels dat
I oughter try and do somethin' fur her, too, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
long as I kin; an' I can't expect to go about
much longer, Mah'sr Harry; de ole wrapper's
pretty nigh gin out."</p>

<p>"I don't mind your taking your meals there,
now and then," said Harry; "but I don't want
you to live there. We can't afford it."</p>

<p>"All right, Mah'sr Harry," said Uncle Braddock,
and after that he never came to Aunt
Matilda's to meals more than five or six times a
week.</p>

<p>And now Christmas, always a great holiday
with the negroes of the South, was approaching,
and Harry and Kate determined to try and
give Aunt Matilda extra good living during
Christmas week, and to let her have company
every day if she wanted it.</p>

<p>Harry had a pig. He got it in the spring
when it was very small, and when its little tail
was scarcely long enough to curl. There was a
story about his getting this pig.</p>

<p>He and some other boys had been out walking,
and several dogs went along with them.
The dogs chased a cat&mdash;a beautiful, smooth cat,
that belonged to old Mr. Truly Matthews. The
cat put off at the top of her speed, which was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
good deal better than any speed the dogs could
show, and darted up a tree right in front of her
master's house. The dogs surrounded the tree
and barked as if they expected to bark the tree
down. One little fuzzy dog, with short legs and
hair all over his eyes, actually jumped into a
low crotch, and the boys thought he was going
to try to climb the tree. If he had ever reached
the cat he would have been very sorry
he had not stayed at home, for she was a good
deal bigger than he was. Harry and his friends
endeavored to drive the dogs away from the
tree, but it was of no use. Even kicks and
blows only made them bark the more. Directly
out rushed Mr. Truly Matthews, as angry as he
could be. He shouted and scolded at the boys
for setting their dogs on his cat, and then he
kicked the dogs out of his yard in less time than
you could count seventy-two. He was very
angry, indeed, and talked about the shocking
conduct of the boys to everybody in the village.
He would listen to no explanations or excuses.</p>

<p>Harry was extremely sorry that Mr. Matthews
was so incensed against him, especially as
he knew there was no cause for it, and he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
talking about it to Kate one day, when she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what will be sure to pacify
Mr. Matthews, Harry. He has a lot of little
pigs that he wants to sell. Just you go and buy
one of them, and see if he isn't as good-natured
as ever, when he sees your money."</p>

<p>Harry took the advice. He had a couple of
dollars, and with them he bought a little pig,
the smallest of the lot; and Mr. Matthews, who
was very much afraid he could not find purchasers
for all his pigs, was as completely pacified
as Kate thought he would be.</p>

<p>Harry took his property home, and all
through the summer and fall the little pig ran
about the yard and the fields and the woods,
and ate acorns&mdash;and sweet potatoes and turnips
when he could get a chance to root them up
with his funny little twitchy nose&mdash;and grunted
and slept in the sun; and about the middle of
December he had grown so big that Harry sold
him for eleven dollars. Here was quite a capital
for Christmas.</p>

<p>"I can't afford to spend it all on Aunt
Matilda," said Harry to his mother and Kate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
"for I have other things to do with my money.
But she's bound to have a good Christmas, and
we'll make her a present besides."</p>

<p>Kate was delighted with his idea, and immediately
began to suggest all sorts of things for
the present. If Harry chose to buy anything
that she could "make up," she would go right
to work at it. But Harry could not think of
anything that would suit exactly, and neither
could Kate, nor their mother; and when Mr.
Loudon was taken into council, at dinner-time,
he could suggest nothing but an army blanket&mdash;which
suggestion met with no favor at all.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Loudon advised that they should
ask Aunt Matilda what she would like to have
for a present.</p>

<p>"There's no better way of suiting her than
that," said he.</p>

<p>So Harry and Kate went down to the old
woman's cabin that afternoon, after school, and
asked her.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda did not hesitate an instant.</p>

<p>"Ef you chil'en is really a-goin' to give me a
present, there ain't nothin' I'd rather have than
a Chrismis tree."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"A Christmas tree!" cried Harry and Kate
both bursting out laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, chil'en. Ef ye give me anything,
give me a good big fiery Chrismis tree
like you all had, year 'fore las'."</p>

<p>Two years before, Harry and Kate had had
their last Christmas tree. There were no younger
children, and these two were now considered
to have outgrown that method of celebrating
Christmas. But they had missed their tree last
year&mdash;missed it very much.</p>

<p>And now Aunt Matilda wanted one. It was
the very thing!</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Harry; "you shall have it.
Hurrah for Aunt Matilda's Christmas tree!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Kate; "won't it be splendid?
Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Uncle Braddock, who was
just coming up to the cabin door, but he did not
shout very loud, and nobody heard him.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! I wonder what dey's all hurrahin'
about?" he said to himself.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate had started off to run home
with the news, but Aunt Matilda told the old
man all about it, and when he heard there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to be a Christmas tree, he was just as glad as
anybody.</p>

<p>When it became generally known that Aunt
Matilda was to have a Christmas tree, the people
of the neighborhood took a great interest in
the matter. John Walker and Dick Ford, two
colored men of the vicinity, volunteered to get
the tree. But when they went out into the
woods to cut it, eighteen other colored people,
big and little, followed them, some to help and
some to give advice.</p>

<p>A very fine tree was selected. It was a pine,
ten feet high, and when they brought it into
Aunt Matilda's cabin, they could not stand it
upright, for her ceiling was rather low.</p>

<p>When Harry and Kate came home from
school they were rather surprised to see so big
a tree, but it was such a fine one that they
thought they must have it. After some consideration
it was determined to erect it in a deserted
cabin, near by, which had no upper floor, and
was high enough to allow the tree to stand up
satisfactorily. This was, indeed, an excellent
arrangement, for it was better to keep the decoration
of the Christmas tree a secret from Aunt
Matilda until all was completed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was a holiday, and Harry and
Kate went earnestly to work. A hole was dug
in the clay floor of the old cabin, and the tree
planted firmly therein. It was very firm, indeed,
for a little colored boy named Josephine's Bobby
climbed nearly to the topmost branch, without
shaking it very much. For four or five days the
work of decorating the tree went on. Everybody
talked about it, a great many laughed at
it, and nearly everybody seemed inclined to give
something to hang upon its branches. Kate
brought a large box containing the decorations of
her last Christmas tree, and she and Harry
hung sparkling balls, and golden stars, and silver
fishes, and red and blue paper angels, and candy
swans, and sugar pears, and glittering things of
all sorts, shapes, and sizes upon the boughs.
Harry had a step-ladder, and Dick Ford and five
colored boys held it firmly while he stood on it
and tied on the ornaments. Very soon the
neighbors began to send in their contributions.
Mrs. Loudon gave a stout woollen dress, which
was draped over a lower branch; while Mr.
Loudon, who was not to be diverted from his
original idea, sent an army blanket, which Kate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
arranged around the root of the tree, so as to
look as much as possible like gray moss. Mr.
Darby, who kept the store, sent a large paper
bag of sugar and a small bag of tea, which were
carefully hung on lower branches. Miss Jane
Davis thought she ought to do something, and
she contributed a peck of sweet potatoes, which,
each tied to a string, were soon dangling from
the branches. Then Mr. Truly Matthews, who
did not wish to be behind his neighbors in generosity,
sent a shoulder of bacon, which looked
quite magnificent as it hung about the middle of
the tree. Other people sent bars of soap, bags
of meal, packages of smoking-tobacco, and flannel
petticoats. A pair of shoes was contributed,
and several pairs of stockings, which latter were
filled with apples and hickory-nuts by the considerate
Kate. Several of the school children
gave sticks of candy; and old Mrs. Sarah Page,
who had nothing else to spare, brought a jug of
molasses, which was suspended near the top of
the tree. Kate did not fancy the appearance of
the jug, and she wreathed it with strings of glittering
glass balls; and the shoulder of bacon
she stuck full of red berries and holly-leaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Harry contributed a bright red handkerchief for
Aunt Matilda's head, and Kate gave a shawl
which was yellower than a sunflower, if such a
thing could be. And Harry bore the general expenses
of the "extras," which were not trifling.</p>

<p>When Christmas eve arrived everybody came
to see Aunt Matilda's Christmas tree. Kate and
Harry were inside superintending the final arrangements,
and about fifty or sixty persons,
colored and white, were gathered around the
closed door of the old cabin. When all was
ready Aunt Matilda made her appearance, supported
on either side by Dick Ford and John
Walker, while Uncle Braddock, in his many-colored
dressing-gown, followed close behind.
Then the door was opened, and Aunt Matilda
entered, followed by as many of the crowd as
could get in. It was certainly a scene of splendor.
A wood fire blazed in the fireplace at one
end of the cabin, while dozens of tallow candles
lighted up the tree. The gold and silver stars
glistened, the many-colored glass balls shone
among the green pine boughs; the shoulder of
bacon glowed like a bed of flowers, while the jug
of molasses hung calm and serene, surrounded by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
its glittering beads. A universal buzz of approbation
and delight arose. No one had ever seen
such a Christmas tree before. Every bough and
every branch bore something useful as well as
ornamental.</p>

<p>As for Aunt Matilda, for several moments
she remained speechless with delight. At last
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Laws-a-massey! It's wuth while being
good for ninety-five years to git such a tree at
las'."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Lively Team.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>"I want you to understand, Harry," said Mr.
Loudon, one day, "that I do not disapprove
of what you and Kate are doing for old Aunt
Matilda. On the contrary, I feel proud of you
both. The idea was honorable to you, and, so
far, you have done very well; better than I
expected; and I believe I was a little more sanguine
than any one else in the village. But you
must not forget that you have something else to
think of besides making money for Aunt Matilda."</p>

<p>"But, don't I think of other things, father?"
said Harry. "I'm sure I get along well enough
at school."</p>

<p>"That may be, my boy; but I want you to
get along better than well enough."</p>

<p>This little conversation made quite an impression
on Harry, and he talked to Kate about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose father's right," said she; "but
what's to be done about it? Is that poor old
woman to have only half enough to eat, so that
you may read twice as much Virgil?"</p>

<p>Harry laughed.</p>

<p>"But perhaps she will have five-eighths of
enough to eat if I only read nine-sixteenths as
much Latin," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh! you're always poking arithmetic fun
at me," said Kate. "But I tell you what you
can do," she continued. "You can get up half
an hour earlier, every morning, and that will
give you a good deal of extra time to think about
your lessons."</p>

<p>"I can <i>think</i> about them in bed," said
Harry.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Kate; and she went on
with her work. She was knitting a "tidy,"
worth two pounds of sugar, or half a pound of
tea, when it should be finished.</p>

<p>Harry did not get up any earlier; for, as he
expressed it, "It was dreadfully cold before
breakfast," on those January mornings; but his
father and mother noticed that the subject of
Aunt Matilda's maintenance did not so entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
engross the conversation of the brother and
sister in the evenings; and they had their heads
together almost as often over slate and schoolbooks
as over the little account-book in which
Kate put down receipts and expenditures.</p>

<p>On a Thursday night, about the middle of
January, there was a fall of snow. Not a very
heavy fall; the snow might have been deeper,
but it was deep enough for sledding. On the
Friday, Harry, in connection with another boy,
Tom Selden, several years older than himself,
concocted a grand scheme. They would haul
wood, on a sled, all day Saturday.</p>

<p>It was not to be any trifling little "boy-play"
wood-hauling. Harry's father owned a woodsled&mdash;one
of the very few sleds or sleighs in the
county&mdash;which was quite an imposing affair, as
to size, at least. It was about eight feet long
and four feet wide; and although it was rough
enough,&mdash;being made of heavy boards, nailed
transversely upon a couple of solid runners, with
upright poles to keep the load in its place&mdash;it
was a very good sled, as far as it went, which
had not been very far of late; for there had
been no good sledding for several seasons. Old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Mr. Truly Matthews had a large pile of wood
cut in a forest about a mile and a half from the
village, and the boys knew that he wanted it
hauled to the house, and that, by a good day's
work, considerable money could be made.</p>

<p>All the arrangements were concluded on Friday,
which was a half-holiday, on account of the
snow making travelling unpleasant for those
scholars who lived at a distance. Harry's father
gave his consent to the plan, and loaned his sled.
Three negro men agreed to help for one-fourth
of the profits. Tom Selden went into the affair,
heart and hand, agreeing to take his share out
in fun. What money was made, after paying
expenses, was to go into the Aunt Matilda Fund,
which was tolerably low about that time.</p>

<p>Kate gave her earnest sanction to the
scheme, which was quite disinterested on her
part, for, being a girl, she could not very well go
on a wood-hauling expedition, and she could expect
to do little else but stay at home and calculate
the probable profits of the trips.</p>

<p>The only difficulty was to procure a team;
and nothing less than a four-horse team would
satisfy the boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Loudon lent one horse, old Selim, a big
brown fellow, who was very good at pulling
when he felt in the humor. Tom could bring
no horse; for his father did not care to lend his
horses for such a purpose. He was afraid they
might get their legs broken; and, strange as it
seemed to the boys, most of the neighbors appeared
to have similar notions. Horses were
very hard to borrow that Friday afternoon.
But a negro man, named Isaac Waddell, agreed
to hire them his horse Hector, for fifty cents for
the day; and the storekeeper, after much persuasion,
lent a big gray mule, Grits by name.
There was another mule in the village, which
the boys could have if they wanted her; but
they did not want her&mdash;that is, if they could get
anything else with four legs that would do to go
in their team. This was Polly, a little mule,
belonging to Mrs. Dabney, who kept the post-office.
Polly was not only very little in size, but
she was also very little given to going. She did
not particularly object to a walk, if it were not
too long, and would pull a buggy or carry a man
with great complacency, but she seldom indulged
in trotting. It was of no use to whip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
her. Her skin was so thick, or so destitute of
feeling, that she did not seem to take any notice
of a good hard crack. Polly was not a favorite,
but she doubtless had her merits, although no
one knew exactly what they were. Perhaps the
best thing that could be said about her was, that
she did not take up much room.</p>

<p>But, on Saturday, it was evident that Polly
would have to be taken, for no animal could be
obtained in her place.</p>

<p>So, soon after breakfast, the team was collected
in Mr. Loudon's back-yard, and harnessed
to the sled. Besides the three negroes who had
been hired, there were seven volunteers&mdash;some
big and some little&mdash;who were very willing to
work for nothing, if they might have a ride on
the sled. The harness was not the best in the
world; some of it was leather, and some was
rope and some was chain. It was gathered together
from various quarters, like the team&mdash;nobody
seemed anxious to lend good harness.</p>

<p>Grits and thin Hector were the leaders, and
Polly and old Selim were the pole-horses, so to
speak.</p>

<p>When all the straps were buckled, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
chains hooked, and the knots tied (and this took
a good while as there were only twelve men and
boys to do it), Dick Ford jumped on old Selim,
little Johnny Sand, as black as ink, was hoisted
on Grits, and Gregory Montague, a tall yellow
boy, with high boots and no toes to them, bestrode
thin Hector. Harry, Tom, and nine
negroes (two more had just come into the yard)
jumped on the sled. Dick Ford cracked his
whip; Kate stood on the back-door step and
clapped her hands; all the darkies shouted; Tom
and Harry hurrahed; and away they did not go.</p>

<p>Polly was not ready.</p>

<p>And what was more, old brown Selim was
perfectly willing to wait for her. He looked
around mildly at the little mule, as if he would
say: "Now, don't be in a hurry, my good Polly.
Be sure you're right before you go ahead."</p>

<p>Polly was quite sure she was not right, and
stood as stiffly as if she had been frozen to the
ground, and all the cracking of whips and shouting
of "Git up!" "Go 'long!" "What do you
mean, dar? you Polly!" made no impression
on her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Harry made his voice heard above the
hubbub.</p>

<p>"Never mind Polly!" he shouted. "Let
her alone. Dick, and you other fellows, just
start off your own horses. Now, then! Get up,
all of you!"</p>

<p>At this, every rider whipped up his horse
or his mule, and spurred him with his heels, and
every darkey shouted, "Hi, dar!" and off they
went, rattledy-bang!</p>

<p>Polly went, too. There was never such an
astonished little mule in this world! Out of the
gate they all whirled at full gallop, and up the
road, tearing along. Negroes shouting, chains
rattling, snow flying back from sixteen pounding
hoofs, sled cutting through the snow like a ship
at sea, and a little darkey shooting out behind
at every bounce over a rough place!</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Harry, holding tight to an
upright pole. "Isn't this splendid!"</p>

<p>"Splendid! It's glorious!" shouted Tom.
"It's better than being a pi&mdash;" And down he
went on his knees, as the big sled banged over a
stone in the road, and Josephine's Bobby was
bounced out into a snow-drift under a fence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether Tom intended to say a pirate or a
pyrotechnic, was never discovered; but, in six
minutes, there was only one of the small darkies
left on the sled. The men, and this one, John
William Webster, hung on to the poles as if they
were glued there.</p>

<p>As for Polly, she was carried along faster
than she ever went before in her life. She
jumped, she skipped, she galloped, she slid, she
skated; sometimes sitting down, and sometimes
on her feet, but flying along, all the same, no
matter how she chose to go.</p>

<p>And so, rattling, shouting, banging, bouncing;
snow flying and whips cracking, on they
sped, until John William Webster's pole came
out, and clip! he went heels over head into the
snow.</p>

<p>But John William had a soul above tumbles.
In an instant he jerked himself up to his feet,
dropped the pole, and dashed after the sled.</p>

<p>Swiftly onward went the sled and right behind
came John William, his legs working like
steamboat wheels, his white teeth shining, and
his big eyes sparkling!</p>

<p>There was no stopping the sled; but there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was no stopping John William, either, and in less
than two minutes he reached the sled, grabbed a
man by the leg, and tugged and pulled until he
seated himself on the end board.</p>

<p>"I tole yer so!" said he, when he got his
breath. And yet he hadn't told anybody anything.</p>

<p>And now the woods were reached, and after
a deal of pulling and shouting, the team was
brought to a halt, and then slowly led through
a short road to where the wood was piled.</p>

<p>The big mule and the horses steamed and
puffed a little, but Polly stood as calm as a
rocking-horse.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rapidity of the drive, it
was late when the party reached the woods.
The gathering together and harnessing of the
team had taken much longer than they expected;
and so the boys set to work with a will to load
the sled; for they wanted to make two trips
that morning. But although they all, black and
white, worked hard, it was slow business. Some
of the wood was cut and split properly, and
some was not, and then the sled had to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
turned around, and there was but little room to
do it in, and so a good deal of time was lost.</p>

<p>But at last the sled was loaded up, and they
were nearly ready to start, when John William
Webster, who had run out to the main road, set
up a shout:</p>

<p>"Oh! Mah'sr Harry! Mah'sr Tom!"</p>

<p>Harry and Tom ran out to the road, and
stood there petrified with astonishment.</p>

<p>Where was the snow?</p>

<p>It was all gone, excepting a little here and
there in the shade of the fence corners. The
day had turned out to be quite mild, and the
sun, which was now nearly at its noon height,
had melted it all away.</p>

<p>Here was a most unlooked-for state of
affairs! What was to be done? The boys ran
back to the sled, and the colored men ran out
to the road, and everybody talked and nobody
seemed to say anything of use.</p>

<p>At last Dick Ford spoke up:</p>

<p>"I tell ye what, Mah'sr Harry! I say, just
let's go 'long," said he.</p>

<p>"But how are you going to do it?" said
Harry. "There's no snow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that; but de mud's jist as slippery as
grease. That thar team kin pull it, easy 'nuff!"</p>

<p>Harry and Tom consulted together, and
agreed to drive out to the road and try what
could be done, and then, if the loaded sled was
too much for the team, they would throw off the
wood and go home with the empty sled.</p>

<p>There was snow enough until they reached
the road&mdash;for very little had melted in the
woods&mdash;and when they got fairly out on the
main road the team did not seem to mind the
change from snow to thin mud.</p>

<p>The load was not a very heavy one, and
there were two horses and two mules&mdash;a pretty
strong team.</p>

<p>Polly did very well. She was now harnessed
with Grits in the lead; and she pulled along
bravely. But it was slow work, compared to
the lively ride over the snow. The boys and
the men trudged through the mud, by the side
of the sled, and, looking at it in the best possible
light, it was a very dull way to haul wood.
The boys agreed that after this trip they would
be very careful not to go on another mud-sledding
expedition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>But soon they came to a long hill, and,
going down this, the team began to trot, and
Harry and Tom and one or two of the men
jumped on the edges of the sled, outside of the
load, holding on to the poles. Then Grits, the
big mule, began to run, and Gregory couldn't
hold him in, and old Selim and thin Hector and
little Polly all struck out on a gallop, and away
they went, bumping and thumping down the hill.</p>

<p>And then stick after stick, two sticks, six
sticks, a dozen sticks at a time, slipped out
behind.</p>

<p>It was of no use to catch at them to hold
them on. They were not fastened down in any
way, and Harry and Tom and the men on the
sled had as much as they could do to hold
themselves on.</p>

<p>When they reached the bottom of the hill
the pulling became harder; but Grits had no
idea of stopping for that. He was bound for
home. And so he plunged on at the top of his
speed. But the rest of the team did not fancy
going so fast on level ground, and they slackened
their pace.</p>

<p>This did not suit Grits. He gave one tremendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
bound, burst loose from his harness
and dashed ahead. Up went his hind legs in
the air; off shot Gregory Montague into the
mud, and then away went Grits, clipperty-clap!
home to his stable.</p>

<p>When Harry and Tom, the two horses, the
little mule, the eight colored men, the sled,
John William Webster and eleven logs of wood
reached the village it was considerably after
dinner-time.</p>

<p>When the horse-hire was paid, and something
was expended for mending borrowed harness,
and the negroes had received a little present
for their labor, the Aunt Matilda Fund was
diminished by the sum of three dollars and
eighty cents.</p>

<p>Mr. Truly Matthews agreed to say nothing
about the loss of his wood that was scattered
along the road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Business in Earnest.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Although Harry did not find his wood-hauling
speculation very profitable, it was
really of advantage to him, for it gave him an
idea.</p>

<p>And his idea was a very good one. He saw
clearly enough that money could be made by
hauling wood, and he was also quite certain
that it would never do for him to take his time,
especially during school term, for that purpose.
So, after consultation with his father, and after
a great deal of figuring by Kate, he determined
to go into the business in a regular way.</p>

<p>About five miles from the village was a railroad
station, and it was also a wood station.
Here the railroad company paid two dollars a
cord for wood delivered on their grounds.</p>

<p>Two miles from the station, on the other side
of Crooked Creek, Harry's father owned a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
tract of forest land, and here Harry received
permission to cut and take away all the wood
that he wanted. Mr. Loudon was perfectly willing,
in this way, to help his children in their
good work.</p>

<p>So Harry made arrangements with Dick
Ford and John Walker, who were not regularly
hired to any one that winter, to cut and haul his
wood for him, on shares. John Walker had a
wagon, which was merely a set of wheels, with a
board floor laid on the axletrees, and the use of
this he contributed in consideration of a little
larger share in the profits. Harry hired Grits
and another mule at a low rate, as there was not
much for mules to do at that time of the year.</p>

<p>The men were to cut up and deliver the
wood and get receipts for it from the station-master;
and it was to be Harry's business to
collect the money at stated times, and divide
the proceeds according to the rate agreed upon.
Harry and his father made the necessary arrangements
with the station-master, and thus
all the preliminaries were settled quite satisfactorily.</p>

<p>In a few days the negroes were at work, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
as they both lived but a short distance from the
creek, on the village side, it was quite convenient
for them. John Walker had a stable in
which to keep the mules, and the cost of their
feed was also to be added to his share of the
profits.</p>

<p>In a short time Harry had quite a number
of applications from negroes who wished to cut
wood for him, but he declined to hire any additional
force until he saw how his speculation
would turn out.</p>

<p>Old Uncle Braddock pleaded hard to be
employed. He could not cut wood, nor could
he drive a team, but he was sure he would be of
great use as overseer.</p>

<p>"You see, Mah'sr Harry," he said, "I lib
right on de outside edge ob you' pa's woods,
and I kin go ober dar jist as easy as nuffin, early
every mornin', and see dat dem boys does dere
work, and don't chop down de wrong trees.
Mind now, I tell ye, you all will make a pile o'
money ef ye jist hire me to obersee dem boys."</p>

<p>For some time Harry resisted his entreaties,
but at last, principally on account of Kate's argument
that the old man ought to be encouraged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in making something toward his living, if he were
able and willing to do so, Harry hired him on
his own terms, which were ten cents a day.</p>

<p>About four o'clock every afternoon during
his engagement, Uncle Braddock made his appearance
in the village, to demand his ten cents.
When Harry remonstrated with him on his quitting
work so early, he said:</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Mah'sr Harry, it's a long
way from dem woods here, and I got to go all
de way back home agin; and it gits dark mighty
early dese short days."</p>

<p>In about a week the old man came to Hurry
and declared that he must throw up his engagement.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"I'm gwine to gib up dat job, Mah'sr Harry."</p>

<p>"But why? You wanted it bad enough,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"But I'm gwine to gib it up now," said the
old man.</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to tell me your reasons
for giving it up," persisted Harry.</p>

<p>Uncle Braddock stood silent for a few minutes,
and then he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mah'sr Harry, dis is jist de truf; dem
ar boys, dey ses to me dat ef I come foolin'
around dere any more, dey'd jist chop me up,
ole wrapper an' all, and haul me off fur kindlin'
wood. Dey say I was dry enough. An' dey
needn't a made sich a fuss about it, fur I didn't
trouble 'em much; hardly eber went nigh 'em.
Ten cents' worf o' oberseein' aint a-gwine to
hurt nobody."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Braddock," said Harry, laughing,
"I think you're wise to give it up."</p>

<p>"Dat's so," said the old negro, and away he
trudged to Aunt Matilda's cabin, where, no
doubt, he ate a very good ten cents' worth of
corn-meal and bacon.</p>

<p>This wood enterprise of Harry's worked
pretty well on the whole. Sometimes the men
cut and hauled quite steadily, and sometimes
they did not. Once every two weeks Harry rode
over to the station, and collected what was due
him; and his share of the profits kept Aunt
Matilda quite comfortably.</p>

<p>But, although Kate was debarred from any
share in this business, she worked every day at
her tidies for the store, and knit stockings, besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
for some of the neighbors, who furnished
the yarn and paid her a fair price. There were
people who thought Mrs. Loudon did wrong in
allowing her daughter to work for money in this
way, but Kate's mother said that the end justified
the work, and that so long as Kate persevered
in her self-appointed tasks, she should not
interfere.</p>

<p>As for Kate, she said she should work on, no
matter how much money Harry made. There
was no knowing what might happen.</p>

<p>But the most important of Kate's duties was
the personal attention she paid to Aunt Matilda.
She went over to the old woman's cabin every
day or two, and saw that she was kept warm and
had what she needed.</p>

<p>And these visits had a good influence on the
old woman, for her cabin soon began to look
much neater, now that a nice little girl came to
see her so often.</p>

<p>When the spring came on, Aunt Matilda
actually took it into her head to whitewash her
cabin, a thing she had not done for years. She
and Uncle Braddock worked at it by turns.
The old woman was too stiff and rheumatic to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
keep at such work long at a time; but she was
very proud of her whitewashing; and when she
was tired of working at the inside of her
cabin, she used to go out and whitewash the
trunks of the trees around the house. She had
seen trees thus ornamented, and she thought
they were perfectly beautiful.</p>

<p>Kate was violently opposed to anything of
this kind, and, at last, told Aunt Matilda that if
she persisted in surrounding her house with
what looked like a forest of tombstones, she,
Kate, would have to stop coming there.</p>

<p>So Aunt Matilda, in a manner, desisted.</p>

<p>But one day she noticed a little birch-tree,
some distance from the house, and the inclination
to whitewash that little birch was too
strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>"He's so near white, anyway," she said to
herself, "dat it's a pity not to finish him."</p>

<p>So off she hobbled with a tin cup full of
whitewash and a small brush to adorn the little
birch-tree, leaving her cabin in the charge of
Holly Thomas.</p>

<p>Holly, whose whole name was Hollywood
Cemetery Thomas, was a little black girl, between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
two and five years old. Sometimes she
seemed nearly five, and sometimes not more than
two. Her parents intended christening her
Minerva, but hearing the name of the well-known
Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, they
thought it so pretty that they gave it to their
little daughter, without the slightest idea, however,
that it was the name of a grave-yard.</p>

<p>Holly had come over to pay a morning visit
to Aunt Matilda, and she had brought her only
child, a wooden doll, which she was trying to
teach to walk, by dragging it head foremost by
a long string tied around its neck.</p>

<p>"Now den, you Holly, you stay h'yar and
mind de house while I's gone," said Aunt Matilda,
as she departed.</p>

<p>"All yite," said the little darkey, and she sat
down on the floor to prepare her child for a coat
of whitewash; but she had not yet succeeded in
convincing the doll of the importance of the
operation when her attention was aroused by a
dog just outside of the door.</p>

<p>It was Kate's little woolly white dog, Blinks,
who often used to come to the cabin with her,
and who sometimes, when he got a chance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
run away, used to come alone, as he did this
morning.</p>

<p>"Go 'way dar, litty dog," said Miss Holly,
"yer can't come in; dere's nobody home. Yun
'long, now, d'yer y'ear!"</p>

<p>But Blinks either did not hear or did not care,
for he stuck his head in at the door.</p>

<p>"Go 'way, dere!" shouted Holly. "Aunt
Tillum ain't home. Go 'way now, and tum bat
in half an hour. Aunt Tillum'll be bat den.
Don't yer hear now, go <i>'way</i>!"</p>

<p>But, instead of going away, Blinks trotted in,
as bold as a four-pound lion.</p>

<p>"Go 'way, go 'way!" screamed Holly, squeezing
herself up against the wall in her terror, and
then Blinks barked at her. He had never seen a
little black girl behave so, in the whole course of
his life, and it was quite right in him to bark and
let her know what he thought of her conduct.
Then Holly, in her fright, dropped her doll, and
when Blinks approached to examine it, she
screamed louder and louder, and Blinks barked
more and more, and there was quite a hubbub.
In the midst of it a man put his head in at the
door of the cabin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a tall man, with red hair, and a red
freckled face, and a red bristling moustache, and
big red hands.</p>

<p>"What's all this noise about?" said he; and
when he saw what it was, he came in.</p>

<p>"Get out of this, you little beast!" said he
to Blinks, and putting the toe of his boot under
the little dog, he kicked him clear out of the
door of the cabin. Then turning to Holly, he
looked at her pretty much as if he intended to
kick her out too. But he didn't. He put out
one of his big red hands and said to her:</p>

<p>"Shake hands."</p>

<p>Holly obeyed without a word, and then
snatching her wooden child from the floor, she
darted out of the door and reached the village
almost as soon as poor Blinks.</p>

<p>In a minute or two Aunt Matilda made her
appearance at the door. She had heard the
barking and the screaming, and had come to see
what was the matter.</p>

<p>When she saw the man, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, Mah'sr George! Is dat you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," said the man. "Shake
hands, Aunt Matilda."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you was down in Mississippi;
Mah'sr George," said the old woman; "and I
thought you was gwine to stay dar."</p>

<p>"Couldn't do it," said the man. "It didn't
suit me, down there. Five years of it was
enough for me."</p>

<p>"Enough fur dem, too, p'r'aps!" said Aunt
Matilda, with a grim chuckle.</p>

<p>The man took no notice of her remark, but
said:</p>

<p>"I didn't intend to stop here, but I heard
such a barking and screaming in your cabin, that
I turned out of my way to see what the row
was about. I've just come up from the railroad.
Does old Michaels keep store here yet?"</p>

<p>"No, he don't," said Aunt Matilda; "he's
dead. Mah'sr Darby keeps dar now."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" cried the man. "Why, it
was on old Michaels's account that I was sneakin'
around the village. Why, I'm mighty glad
I stopped here. It makes things different if old
Michaels isn't about."</p>

<p>"Well, ye might as well go 'long," said Aunt
Matilda, who seemed to be getting into a bad
humor. "There's others who knows jist as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
much about yer bad doin's as Mah'sr Michaels
did."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean that meddling humbug,
John Loudon," said the man.</p>

<p>"Now, look h'yar, you George Mason?"
cried Aunt Matilda, making one long step toward
the whitewash bucket; "jist you git out
o' dat dar door!" and she seized the whitewash
brush and gave it a terrific swash in the
bucket.</p>

<p>The man looked at her&mdash;he knew her of
old&mdash;and then he left the cabin almost as quickly
as Blinks and Holly went out of it.</p>

<p>"Ef it hadn't been fur dat little dog," said
Aunt Matilda, grimly, "he'd a gone on. Them
little dogs is always a-doin' mischief."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Meeting on the Road.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Some weeks before the little affair between
Blinks and Holly, related in our last chapter,
Harry and Kate took a ride over to the railroad
station.</p>

<p>During the winter Harry had frequently gone
over on horseback to attend to the payments
for his wood; and now that the roads were in fit
condition for carriage travel, he was glad to
have an opportunity to take the buggy and give
Kate a ride.</p>

<p>For some days previously, Crooked Creek
had been "up;" that is, the spring rains had
caused it to overflow, and all travel across it had
been suspended. The bridges on such occasions&mdash;and
Crooked Creek had a bad habit of being
"up" several times in the course of a year&mdash;were
covered, and the lowlands were under
water for a considerable distance on each side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the stream. There were so few boats on the
creek, and the current, in time of freshets, was
so strong, that ferriage was seldom thought of.
In consequence of this state of affairs Harry had
not heard from his wood-cutters for more than
a week, as they had not been able to cross the
creek to their homes. It was, therefore, as much
to see how they were getting along as to attend
to financial matters that he took this trip.</p>

<p>It was a fine, bright day in very early spring,
and old Selim trotted on quite gayly. Before
very long they overtook Miles Jackson, jogging
along on a little bay horse.</p>

<p>Miles was a black man, very sober and sedate
who for years had carried the mail twice a week
from a station farther up the railroad to the village.
But he was not a mail-carrier now. His
employer, a white man, who had the contract for
carrying the mails, had also gone into another
business which involved letter-carrying.</p>

<p>A few miles back from the village of Akeville,
where the Loudons lived, was a mica mine,
which had recently been bought, and was now
worked by a company from the North. This
mica (the semi-transparent substance that is set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
into stove doors) proved to be very plentiful
and valuable, and the company had a great deal
of business on their hands. It was frequently
necessary to send messages and letters to the
North, and these were always carried over to the
station on the other side of Crooked Creek,
where there was a daily mail and a telegraph
office. The contract to carry these letters and
messages to and from the mines had been given
to Miles's employer, and the steady negro man
had been taken off the mail-route to attend to
this new business.</p>

<p>"Well, Miles," said Harry, as he overtook
him. "How do you like riding on this road?"</p>

<p>"How d' y', Mah'sr Harry? How d' y',
Miss Kate?" said the colored man, touching his
hat and riding up on the side of the road to let
them pass. "I do' know how I likes it yit,
Mah'sr Harry. Don't seem 'xactly nat'ral after
ridin' de oder road so long!"</p>

<p>"You have a pretty big letter-bag there,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"Dat's so," said Miles; "but 'taint dis big
ebery day. Sence de creek's been up I haint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
been able to git across, and dere's piles o' letters
to go ober to-day."</p>

<p>"It must make it rather bad for the company
when the creek rises in this way," said
Harry.</p>

<p>"Dat's so," answered Miles. "Dey gits in a
heap o' trubble when dey can't send dere letters
and git 'em. Though 'taint so many letters
dey sends as telegraphs."</p>

<p>"It's a pity they couldn't have had their
mine on the other side," remarked Kate.</p>

<p>"Dat's so, Miss Kate," said Miles, gravely.
"I reckon dey didn't know about de creek's
gittin' up so often, or dey'd dug dere mine on
de oder side."</p>

<p>Harry and Kate laughed and drove on.</p>

<p>They soon reached Mr. Loudon's woods, but
found no wood-cutters.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the station they saw
Dick Ford and John Walker on the store-porch.</p>

<p>Harry soon discovered that no wood had
been cut for several days, because the creek was
up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"What had that to do with it?" asked
Harry.</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Mah'sr Harry," said John
Walker, "de creek was mighty high, and dere
was no knowin' how things ud turn out. So we
thought we'd jist wait and see."</p>

<p>"So you've been here all the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; been h'yar all de time. Couldn't
go home, you know."</p>

<p>Harry was very sorry to hear of this lost
time, for he knew that his wood-cutting would
come to an end as soon as the season was sufficiently
advanced to give the men an opportunity
of hiring themselves for farm-work; but it
was of no use to talk any more about it; and so,
after depositing Kate at the post-office, where
the post-mistress, who knew her well, gave her
a nice little "snack" of buttermilk, cold fried
chicken, and "light-bread," he went to the station
and transacted his business. He had not
been there for some weeks, and he found quite
a satisfactory sum of money due him, in spite
of the holiday his men had taken. He then
arranged with Dick and John to work on for a
week or two longer&mdash;if "nothing happened;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and after attending to some commissions for the
family, he and Kate set out for home.</p>

<p>But nothing they had done that day was of
so much importance as their meeting with Miles
tuned out to be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Rob.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Blinks was not the only dog on the Loudon
place. There was another one, a
much larger fellow, named Rob.</p>

<p>Rob was a big puppy, in the first place, and
then he grew up to be a tall, long-legged dog,
who was not only very fond of Harry and Kate,
but of almost everybody else. In time he filled
out and became rather more shapely, but he
was always an ungainly dog&mdash;"too big for his
size," as Harry put it.</p>

<p>It was supposed that Rob was partly bloodhound,
but how much of him was bloodhound it
would have been very difficult so say. Kate
thought it was only his ears. They resembled
the ears of a picture of a beautiful African bloodhound
that she had in a book. At all events Rob
showed no signs of any fighting ancestry. He
was as gentle as a calf. Even Blinks was a better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
watch-dog. But then, Rob was only a year
old, and he might improve in time.</p>

<p>But, in spite of his general inutility, Rob was
a capital companion on a country ramble.</p>

<p>And so it happened, one bright day toward
the close of April, that he and Harry and Kate
went out together into the woods, beyond Aunt
Matilda's cabin. Kate's objects in taking the
walk were wild flowers and general spring investigations
into the condition of the woods; but
Harry had an eye to business, although to hear
him talk you would have supposed that he
thought as much about ferns and flowers as
Kate did.</p>

<p>Harry had an idea that it might possibly be
a good thing to hire negroes that year to pick
sumac for him. He was not certain that he
could make it pay, but it was on his mind to
such a degree that he took a great interest in
the sumac-bushes, and hunted about the edges
of the woods, where the bushes were generally
found, to see what was the prospect for a large
crop of leaves that year.</p>

<p>They were in the woods, about a mile from
Aunt Matilda's cabin, and not very far from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
road, when they separated for a short time.
Harry went on ahead, continuing his investigations,
while Kate remained in a little open glade,
where she found some flowers that she determined
to dig up by the roots and transplant into
her garden at home.</p>

<p>While she was at work she heard a heavy
step behind her, and looking up, she saw a tall
man standing by her. He had red hair, a red
face, a red bristling moustache, and big red
hands.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do?" said the man.</p>

<p>Kate stood up, with the plants, which she
had just succeeded in getting out of the ground,
in her apron.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said she.</p>

<p>The man looked at her from head to foot,
and then he said, "Shake hands!" holding out
his big red hand.</p>

<p>But Kate did not offer to take it.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear me?" said he. "I said,
'Shake hands.'"</p>

<p>"I heard you," said Kate.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you do it, then?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate did not answer, and the man repeated
his question.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if I must tell you," said she;
"in the first place, I don't know you; and,
then, I'd rather not shake hands with you, anyway,
because your hands are so dirty."</p>

<p>This might not have been very polite in
Kate, but she was a straightforward girl, and the
man's hands were very dirty indeed, although
water was to be had in such abundance.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" said the man, with
his face considerably redder than before.</p>

<p>"Kate Loudon," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! Loudon, is it? Well, Kate Loudon,
if my hand's too dirty to shake, you'll find
it isn't too dirty to box your ears."</p>

<p>Kate turned pale and shrank back against a
tree. She gave a hurried glance into the woods,
and then she called out, as loudly as she could:
"<i>Harry</i>!"</p>

<p>The man, who had made a step toward her,
now stopped and looked around, as if he would
like to know who Harry was, before going any
further.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then, Harry, who had heard Kate's call,
came running up.</p>

<p>When the man saw him he seemed relieved,
and a curious smile stretched itself beneath his
bristling red moustache.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" cried Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!" Kate exclaimed, as she ran
to him.</p>

<p>"Matter?" said the man. "The matter's
this: I'm going to box her ears."</p>

<p>"Whose ears?"</p>

<p>"That girl's," replied the red-faced man,
moving toward Kate.</p>

<p>"My sister! Not much!"</p>

<p>And Harry stepped between Kate and the
man.</p>

<p>The man stood and looked at him, and he
looked very angrily, too.</p>

<p>But Harry stood bravely before his sister.
His face was flushed and his breath came quickly,
though he was not frightened, not a whit!</p>

<p>And yet there was absolutely nothing that
he could do. He had not his gun with him;
he had not even a stick in his hand, and a stick
would have been of little use against such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
strong man as that, who could have taken Harry
in his big red hands and have thrown him over
the highest fence in the county.</p>

<p>But for all that, the boy stood boldly up
before his sister.</p>

<p>The man looked at him without a word, and
then he stepped aside toward a small dogwood-bush.</p>

<p>For an instant, Harry thought that they
might run away; but it was only for an instant.
That long-legged man could catch them before
they had gone a dozen yards&mdash;at least he
could catch Kate.</p>

<p>The man took out a knife and cut a long and
tolerably thick switch from the bush. Then he
cut off the smaller end and began to trim away
the twigs and leaves.</p>

<p>While doing this he looked at Harry, and
said:</p>

<p>"I think I'll take you first."</p>

<p>Kate's heart almost stopped beating when
she heard this, and Harry turned pale; but still
the brave boy stood before his sister as stoutly
as ever.</p>

<p>Kate tried to call for help, but she had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
voice. What could <i>she</i> do? A boxing on the
ears was nothing, she now thought; she wished
she had not called out, for it was evident that
Harry was going to get a terrible whipping.</p>

<p>She could not bear it! Her dear brother!</p>

<p>She trembled so much that she could not
stand, and she sank down on her knees. Rob,
the dog, who had been lying near by, snapping
at flies, all this time, now came up to comfort
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rob!" she whispered, "I wish you
were a cross dog."</p>

<p>And Rob wagged his tail and lay down by her.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she thought to herself, "oh! I
wonder if any one could make him bite."</p>

<p>"Rob!" she whispered in the dog's ear,
keeping her eyes fixed on the man, who had
now nearly finished trimming his stick. "Rob!
hiss-s-s-s!" and she patted his back.</p>

<p>Rob seemed to listen very attentively.</p>

<p>"Hiss-s-s!" she whispered again, her heart
beating quick and hard.</p>

<p>Rob now raised his head, his big body began
to quiver, and the hair on his back gradually
rose on end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hiss! Rob! Rob!" whispered Kate.</p>

<p>The man had shut up his knife, and was putting
it in his pocket. He took the stick in his
right hand.</p>

<p>All now depended on Rob.</p>

<p>"Oh! will he?" thought Kate, and then she
sprang to her feet and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Catch him, Rob!" she screamed. "Catch
him!"</p>

<p>With a rush, Rob hurled himself full at the
breast of the man, and the tall fellow went over
backward, just like a ten-pin.</p>

<p>Then he was up and out into the road, Rob
after him!</p>

<p>You ought to have seen the gravel fly!</p>

<p>Harry and Kate ran out into the road and
cheered and shouted. Away went the man,
and away went the dog.</p>

<p>Up the road, into the brush, out again, and
then into a field, down a hill, nip and tuck! At
Tom Riley's fence, Rob got him by the leg, but
the trowsers were old and the piece came out:
and then the man dashed into Riley's old tobacco
barn, and slammed the door almost on the
dog's nose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Rob ran around the house to see if there
was an open window, and finding none, he went
back to the door and lay down to wait.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate ran home as fast as they
could, and after a while Rob came too. He had
waited a reasonable time at the door of the barn,

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Tony on the War-path.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>"She did it all," said Harry, when they had
told the tale to half the village, on the
store-porch.</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed Kate. "Rob, you mean."</p>

<p>"That's a good dog," said Mr. Darby, the
storekeeper; "what'll you take for him?"</p>

<p>"Not for sale," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Rob's all very well," remarked Tony Kirk;
"but it won't do to have a feller like that in the
woods, a fright'nin' the children. I'd like to
know who he is."</p>

<p>Just at this moment Uncle Braddock made
his appearance, hurrying along much faster than
he usually walked, with his eyes and teeth glistening
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"I seed him!" he cried, as soon as he came
up.</p>

<p>"Who'd you see?" cried several persons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! I seed de dog after him, and I come
along as fas' as I could, but couldn't come very
fas'. De ole wrapper cotch de wind."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked Tony.</p>

<p>"I seed him a-runnin'. Bress my soul! de
dog like to got him!"</p>

<p>"But who was he, Uncle Braddock?" said
Mr. Loudon, who had just reached the store
from his house, where Kate, who had run home,
had told the story. "Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Know him? Reckon I does?" said Uncle
Braddock, "an' de dog ud a knowed him too, ef
he'd a cotched him! Dat's so, Mah'sr John."</p>

<p>"Well, tell us his name, if you know him,"
said Mr. Darby.</p>

<p>"Ob course, I knows him," said Uncle Braddock.
"I'se done knowed him fur twenty or
fifty years. He's George Mason."</p>

<p>The announcement of this name caused quite
a sensation in the party.</p>

<p>"I thought he was down in Mississippi,"
said one man.</p>

<p>"So he was; I reckons," said Uncle Braddock,
"but he's done come back now. I'se seed
him afore to-day, and Aunt Matilda's seed him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
too. Yah, ha! Dat dere dog come mighty nigh
cotchin' him!"</p>

<p>George Mason had been quite a noted character
in that neighborhood five or six years
before. He belonged to a good family, but was
of a lawless disposition and was generally disliked
by the decent people of the county.
Just before he left for the extreme Southern
States, it was discovered that he had been concerned
in a series of horse-thefts, for which he
would have been arrested had he not taken his
departure from the State.</p>

<p>Few people, excepting Mr. Loudon and one
or two others, knew the extent of his misdemeanors;
and out of regard to his family, these had
not been made public. But he had the reputation
of being a wild, disorderly man, and now
that it was known that he had contemplated
boxing Kate Loudon's ears and whipping Harry,
the indignation was very great.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate were favorites with everybody&mdash;white
and black.</p>

<p>"I tell ye what I'm goin' to do," said Tony
Kirk; "I'm goin' after that feller."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>At this, half a dozen men offered to go along
with Tony.</p>

<p>"What will you do, if you find him?" asked
Mr. Loudon.</p>

<p>"That depends on circumstances," replied
Tony.</p>

<p>"I am willing to have you go," said Mr.
Loudon, who was a magistrate and a gentleman
of much influence in the village, "on condition
that if you find him you offer him no violence.
Tell him to leave the county, and say to him,
from me, that if he is found here again he shall
be arrested."</p>

<p>"All right," said Tony; and he proceeded
to make up his party.</p>

<p>There were plenty of volunteers; and for
a while it was thought that Uncle Braddock intended
to offer to go. But, if so, he must have
changed his mind, for he soon left the village
and went over to Aunt Matilda's and had
a good talk with her. The old woman was
furiously angry when she heard of the affair.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd been a little quicker," she said,
"and dere wouldn't a been a red spot on
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Braddock didn't know exactly what
she meant; but he wished so, too.</p>

<p>Tony didn't want a large party. He chose
four men who could be depended upon, and they
started out that evening.</p>

<p>It was evident that Mason knew how to keep
himself out of sight, for he had been in the
vicinity a week or more&mdash;as Tony discovered,
after a visit to Aunt Matilda&mdash;and no white person
had seen him.</p>

<p>But Tony thought he knew the country
quite as well as George Mason did, and he felt
sure he should find him.</p>

<p>His party searched the vicinity quite thoroughly
that night, starting from Tom Riley's
tobacco barn; but they saw nothing of their
man; and in the morning they made the discovery
that Mason had borrowed one of Riley's
horses, without the knowledge of its owner, and
had gone off, north of the mica mine. Some
negroes had seen him riding away.</p>

<p>So Tony and his men took horses and rode
away after him. Each of them carried his gun,
for they did not know in what company they
might find Mason. A man who steals horses is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
generally considered, especially in the country,
to be wicked enough to do anything.</p>

<p>At a little place called Jordan's cross-roads,
they were sure they had come upon him. Tom
Riley's horse was found at the blacksmith's shop
at the cross-roads, and the blacksmith said that
he had been left there to have a shoe put on,
and that the man who had ridden him had gone
on over the fields toward a house on the edge
of the woods, about a mile away.</p>

<p>So Tony and his men rode up to within
a half-mile of the house, and then they dismounted,
tied their horses, and proceeded on
foot. They kept, as far as possible, under
cover of the tall weeds and bushes, and hurried
along silently and in single file, Tony in the lead.
Thus they soon reached the house, when they
quietly surrounded it.</p>

<p>But George Mason played them a pretty
trick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Cousin Maria.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>After posting one of his men on each side
of the house, which stood on the edge of a
field, without any fence around it, Tony Kirk
stepped up to the front door and knocked. The
door was quickly opened by a woman.</p>

<p>"Why, Cousin Maria," said Tony, "is this
you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it's me, Anthony," said the
woman; "who else should it be?"</p>

<p>Cousin Maria was a tall woman, dressed in
black. She had gray hair and wore spectacles.
She seemed very glad to see Tony, and shook
hands with him warmly.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you lived here," said Tony.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't live here, exactly," said
Cousin Maria; "but come in and sit awhile.
You've been a-huntin', have you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Tony, "I am a-huntin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Without mentioning that he had some friends
outside, Tony went in and sat down to talk with
Cousin Maria. The man in front of the house
had stepped to one side when the door opened,
and the others were out of sight, of course.</p>

<p>Tony entered a small sitting-room, into which
the front door opened, and took a seat by Cousin
Maria.</p>

<p>"You see," said she, "old Billy Simpson let
this house fur a hundred dollars&mdash;there's eighty
acres with it&mdash;to Sarah Ann Hemphill and her
husband; and he's gone to Richmond to git
stock for a wheelwright's shop. That's his trade,
you know; and they're goin' to have the shop
over there in the wagon-house, that can be fixed
up easy enough ef Sam Hemphill chooses to
work at it, which I don't believe he will; but he
<i>can</i> work, ef he will, and this is just the place for
a wheelwright's shop, ef the right man goes into
the business; and they sold their two cows&mdash;keeping
only the red-and-white heifer. I guess
you remember that heifer; they got her of old
Joe Sanders, on the Creek. And they sold one
of their horses&mdash;the sorrel&mdash;and a mule; they
hadn't no use fur 'em here, fur the land's not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
worth much, and hasn't seen no guano nor
nothin' fur three or four years; and the money
they got was enough to start a mighty good
cooper-shop, ef Sam don't spend it all, or most
of it, in Richmond, which I think he will; and
of course, he being away, Sarah Ann wanted to
go to her mother's, and she got herself ready
and took them four children&mdash;and I pity the
old lady, fur Sam's children never had no bringin'
up. I disremember how old Tommy is, but it
isn't over eight, and just as noisy as ef he wasn't
the oldest. And so I come here to take care
of the place; but I can't stay no longer than
Tuesday fortnight, as I told Sarah Ann, fur I've
got to go to Betsey Cropper's then to help her
with her spinnin'; and there's my own things&mdash;seven
pounds of wool to spin fur Truly Mattherses
people, besides two bushel baskets, easy,
of carpet-rags to sew, and I want 'em done by
the time Miss Jane gits her loom empty, or I'll
git no weavin' done this year, and what do you
think? I've had another visitor to-day, and
your comin' right afterwards kind o' struck me
as mighty queer, both bein' Akeville people, so
to speak tho' it's been a long day since he's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
been there, and you'll never guess who it was,
fur it was George Mason."</p>

<p>And she stopped and wiped her face with
her calico apron.</p>

<p>"So George Mason was here, was he?" said
Tony. "Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he's gone," replied Cousin Maria.
"It wasn't more 'n ten or fifteen minutes before
you came in, and he was a-sittin' here talking
about ole times&mdash;he's rougher than he was,
guess he didn't learn no good down there in
Mississippi&mdash;when all ov a sudden he got up an'
took his hat and walked off. Well, that was jist
like George Mason. He never had much manners,
and would always just as soon go off without
biddin' a body good-by as not."</p>

<p>"You didn't notice which way he went, did
you?" asked Tony.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," said Cousin Maria; "he went
out o' the back door, and along the edge of the
woods, and he was soon out of sight, fur George
has got long legs, as you well know; and the
last I saw of him was just out there by that
fence. And if there isn't Jim Anderson! Come
in, Jim; what are you doin' standin' out there?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>So she went to the window to call Jim Anderson,
and Tony stepped to the door and
whistled for the other men, so that when Cousin
Maria came to the door she saw not only Jim
Anderson, but Thomas Campbell and Captain
Bob Winters and Doctor Price's son Brinsley.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word an' honor!" said
Cousin Maria, lifting up both her hands.</p>

<p>"Come along, boys," said Tony, starting off
toward the woods. "We've got no time to
lose. Good-by, Cousin Maria."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Cousin Maria," said each of the
other men, as the party hurried away.</p>

<p>Cousin Maria did not answer a word. She
sat right down on the door-step and took off her
spectacles. She rubbed them with her apron,
and then put them on again. But there was no
mistake. There were the men. If she had seen
four ghosts she could not have been more astonished.</p>

<p>Tony did not for a moment doubt Cousin
Maria's word when she told him that George
Mason had gone away. She never told a lie.
The only trouble with her was that she told too
much truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>In about an hour and a half the five men returned
to the place where they had left their
horses. They had found no trace of George
Mason.</p>

<p>When they reached the clump of trees, there
were no horses there!</p>

<p>They looked at each other with blank faces!</p>

<p>"He's got our horses!" said Jim Anderson,
when his consternation allowed him to speak.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tony, "and sarved us right.
We oughter left one man here to take care uv
'em, knowin' George Mason as we do.'</p>

<p>"I had an idea," said Dr. Price's son Brinsley,
"that we should have done something of
that kind."</p>

<p>"Idees ain't no good," said Tony with a
grunt, as he marched off toward the blacksmith's
shop at Jordan's cross-roads.</p>

<p>The blacksmith had seen nothing of Mason
or the horses, but Tom Riley's horse was still
there; and as the members of the party were all
well known to the blacksmith, he allowed them
to take the animal to its owner. So the five
men rode the one horse back to Akeville; not
all riding at once, but one at a time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Harry's Grand Scheme.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>This wholesale appropriation of horses
caused, of course, a great commotion in
the vicinity of Akeville, and half the male population
turned out the next day in search of George
Mason and the five horses.</p>

<p>Even Harry was infected with the general
excitement, and, mounted on old Selim, he rode
away after dinner (there was no school that
afternoon) to see if he could find any one who
had heard anything. There ought to be news,
for the men had been away all the morning.</p>

<p>About two miles from the village, the road
on which Harry was riding forked, and not
knowing that the party which had started off in
that direction had taken the road which ran to
the northeast, as being the direction in which a
man would probably go, if he wanted to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
away safely with five stolen horses, Harry kept
straight on.</p>

<p>The road was lonely and uninteresting. On
one side was a wood of "old-field pines"&mdash;pines
of recent growth and little value, that spring up
on the old abandoned tobacco fields&mdash;and on the
other a stretch of underbrush, with here and
there a tree of tolerable size, but from which
almost all the valuable timber had been cut.</p>

<p>Selim was inclined to take things leisurely,
and Harry gradually allowed him to slacken his
pace into a walk, and even occasionally to stop
and lower his head to take a bite from some particularly
tempting bunch of grass by the side of
the road.</p>

<p>The fact was, Harry was thinking. He had
entirely forgotten the five horses and everything
concerning them, and was deeply cogitating a
plan which, in an exceedingly crude shape, had
been in his mind ever since he had met old
Miles on the road to the railroad.</p>

<p>What he wished to devise was some good
plan to prevent the interruption, so often caused
by the rising of Crooked Creek, of communication
between the mica mine, belonging to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
New York company, and the station at Hetertown.</p>

<p>If he could do this, he thought he could make
some money by it; and it was, as we all know,
very necessary for him, or at least for Aunt Matilda,
that he should make money.</p>

<p>It was of no use to think of a bridge. There
were bridges already, and when the creek was
"up" you could scarcely see them.</p>

<p>A bridge that would be high enough and
long enough would be very costly, and it
would be an undertaking with which Harry
could not concern himself, no matter what it
might cost.</p>

<p>A ferry was unadvisable, for the stream was
too rapid and dangerous in time of freshets.</p>

<p>There was nothing that was really reliable
and worthy of being seriously thought of but a
telegraph line. This Harry believed to be
feasible.</p>

<p>He did not think it would cost very much.
If this telegraph line only extended across the
creek, not more than half a mile of wire, at the
utmost, would be required.</p>

<p>Nothing need be expended for poles, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
there were tall pine-trees on each side of the
creek that would support the wire; and there
were two cabins, conveniently situated, in which
the instruments could be placed.</p>

<p>Harry had thoroughly considered all these
matters, having been down to the creek several
times on purpose to take observations.</p>

<p>The procuring of the telegraphic instruments,
however, and the necessity of having an operator
on the other side, presented difficulties not easy
to surmount.</p>

<p>But Harry did not despair.</p>

<p>To be sure the machines would cost money,
and so would the wire, insulators, etc., but then
the mica company would surely be willing to
pay a good price to have their messages transmitted
at times when otherwise they would have
to send a man twenty miles to a telegraphic
station.</p>

<p>So if the money could be raised it would
pay to do it&mdash;at least if the calculations, with
which Harry and Kate had been busy for days,
should prove to be correct.</p>

<p>About the operator on the other side, Harry
scarcely knew what to think. If it were necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to hire any one, that would eat terribly into the
profits.</p>

<p>Something economical must be devised for
this part of the plan.</p>

<p>As to the operator on the Akeville side of
the creek, Harry intended to fill that position
himself. He had been interested in telegraphy
for a year or two. He understood the philosophy
of the system, and had had the opportunity
afforded him by the operator at Hetertown of
learning to send messages and to read telegraphic
hieroglyphics. He could not understand
what words had come over the wires, simply by
listening to the clicking of the instrument&mdash;an
accomplishment of all expert telegraphers&mdash;but
he thought he could do quite well enough if he
could read the marks on the paper slips, and
there was no knowing to what proficiency he
might arrive in time.</p>

<p>Of course he had no money to buy telegraphic
apparatus, wire, etc., etc. But he
thought he could get it. "How does any one
build railroads or telegraphic lines?" he had
said to Kate. "Do they take the money out
of their own pockets?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate had answered that she did not suppose
they did, unless the money was there; and
Harry had told her, very confidently, that the
money was never there. No man, or, at least,
very few men, could afford to construct a railroad
or telegraph line. The way these things
were done was by forming a company.</p>

<p>And this was just what Harry proposed to do.</p>

<p>It was, of course, quite difficult to determine
just how large a company this should be. If
it were composed of too many members, the
profits, which would be limited, owing to the
peculiar circumstances of the case, would not
amount to much for each stockholder. And
yet there must be members enough to furnish
money enough.</p>

<p>And more than that, a contract must be
made with the mica-mine people, so that the
business should not be diverted from Harry's
company into any outside channels.</p>

<p>All these things occupied Harry's mind, and
it is no wonder that he hardly looked up when
Selim stopped. The horse had been walking so
slowly that stopping did not seem to make much
difference.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>But when he heard a voice call out, "Oh,
Mah'sr Harry! I'se mighty glad to see yer!"
he looked up quickly enough.</p>

<p>And there was old Uncle Braddock, on horseback!</p>

<p>Harry could scarcely believe his eyes.</p>

<p>And what was more astonishing, the old
negro had no less than four other horses with
him that he was leading, or rather trying to
lead, out of a road through the old-field pines
that here joined the main road.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the meaning of this?" cried
Harry. "Where did you get those horses, Uncle
Braddock?"</p>

<p>And then, without waiting for an answer,
Harry burst out laughing. Such a ridiculous
sight was enough to make anybody laugh.</p>

<p>Uncle Braddock sat on the foremost horse,
his legs drawn up as if he were sitting on a chair,
and a low one at that, for he had been gradually
shortening the stirrups for the last hour, hoping
in that way to get a firmer seat. His long stick
was in one hand, his old hat was jammed down
tightly over his eyes, and his dressing-gown
floated in the wind like a rag-bag out for a holiday.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'se mighty glad to see yer, Mah'sr
Harry!" said he, pulling at his horse's bridle in
such a way as to make him nearly run into Selim
and Harry, who, however, managed to avoid him
and the rest of the cavalcade by moving off to
the other side of the road.</p>

<p>"I was jist a-thinkin' uv gittin' off and lettin'
em go 'long they own se'ves. I never seed sich
hosses fur twistin' up and pullin' crooked. I
'spected to have my neck broke mor' 'n a dozen
times. I never was so disgruntled in all my
born days, Mah'sr Harry. Whoa dar, you yaller
hoss! Won't you take a-hole, Mah'sr Harry,
afore dey're de death uv me?"</p>

<p>The old man had certainly got the horses
into a mixed-up condition. One of them was
beside the horse he rode, two were behind, and
one was wedged in partly in front of these in
such a way that he had to travel sidewise. The
bridle of one horse was tied to that of another,
so that Uncle Braddock led them all by the
bridle of the horse by his side. This was tied to
his long cane, which he grasped firmly in his left
hand.</p>

<p>Harry jumped down from Selim, and, tying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
him to the fence, went over to the assistance of
Uncle Braddock. As he was quite familiar with
horses, Harry soon arranged matters on a more
satisfactory footing. He disentangled the animals,
two of which he proposed to take charge
of himself, and then, after making Uncle Braddock
lengthen his stirrups, and lead both his
horses on one side of him, he fastened the other
two horses side by side, mounted Selim, and
started back for Akeville, followed by Uncle
Braddock and his reduced cavalcade.</p>

<p>The old negro was profuse in his thanks;
but in the middle of his protestations of satisfaction,
Harry suddenly interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Why, look here, Uncle Braddock! Where
did you get these horses? These are the horses
George Mason stole."</p>

<p>"To be sure they is," said Uncle Braddock.
"What would I be a-doin' wid 'em ef they
wasn't?"</p>

<p>"But how did you get them? Tell me
about it," said Harry, checking the impatient
Selim, who, now that his head was turned
homeward, was anxious to go on with as much
expedition as possible under the circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, ye see, Mah'sr Harry," said the old
man, "I was up at Miss Maria's; she said she'd
gi' me some pieces of caliker to mend me wrapper.
I put 'em in me pocket, but I 'spects
they's blowed out; and when I was a-comin'
away fru de woods, right dar whar ole Elick
Potts used to hab his cabin&mdash;reckon you nebber
seed dat cabin; it was all tumbled down 'fore
you was born&mdash;right dar in de clarin' I seed five
horses, all tied to de trees. 'Lor's a massy!' I
said to mesef, 'is de war come agin?' Fur I
nebber seed so many hosses in de woods sence
de war. An' den while I was a-lookin' roun'

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">The Council.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When Harry's mother heard that he had
gone off to try and meet the horse-hunters
she was quite anxious about him.</p>

<p>But Mr. Loudon laughed at her fears.</p>

<p>"If there had been the slightest danger," he
said, "of course I would not have allowed him
to go. But I was glad he wanted to go. A
youngster of his age ought to have a disposition
to see what is going on and to take part, too, for
that matter. I had much rather find it necessary
to restrain Harry than to push him. You
mustn't want to make a girl of him. You would
only spoil the boy, and make a very poor girl."</p>

<p>Mrs. Loudon made no reply. She thought
her husband was a very wise man; but she took
up her key basket and went off to the pantry
with an air that indicated that she had ideas of
her own upon the subject in question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate had no fears for Harry. She had unbounded
faith in his good sense and his bravery,
if he should happen to get into danger.</p>

<p>The fact is, she was quite a brave girl herself;
and brave people are very apt to think their
friends as courageous as themselves.</p>

<p>When Harry and Uncle Braddock reached
the village they found several of the older inhabitants
on the store porch, and they met with
an enthusiastic reception.</p>

<p>And when, later in the afternoon, most of the
men who had gone out after George Mason, returned
from their unsuccessful expedition, the
discussion in regard to Mason's strange proceeding
grew very animated. Some thought he had
only intended to play a trick; others that he
had been unable to get away with the horses, as
he had hoped to do when he had taken them.</p>

<p>But nobody knew anything about the matter
excepting George Mason himself, and he was not
there to give the village any information.</p>

<p>As for Harry, he did not stay long to hear
the discussions at the store.</p>

<p>His mind was full of a much more important
matter and he ran off to find Kate. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
wanted to talk over his latest impressions with
her.</p>

<p>When he reached the house, where his appearance
greatly tranquillized his mother's mind,
he found Kate in the yard under the big catalpa-trees,
always a favorite place of resort in fine
weather.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!" she cried, when she saw him,
"did they find the horses?"</p>

<p>"No," said Harry; "they didn't find them."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a pity! And some of them were
borrowed horses. Tony Kirk had Captain Caseby's
mud-colored horse. I don't know what the
captain will do without him."</p>

<p>"Oh, the captain will do very well," said
Harry.</p>

<p>"But he can't do very well," persisted Kate.
"It's the only horse he has in the world. One
thing certain, they can't go to church."</p>

<p>Harry laughed at this, and then he told his
sister all about his meeting with Uncle Braddock.
But while she was wondering and surmising in
regard to George Mason's strange conduct, Harry,
who could not keep his thoughts from more
important matters, broke in with:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, I say, Kate, I've made up my mind
about the telegraph business. There must be a
company, and we ought to plan it all out before
we tell people and sell shares."</p>

<p>"That's right," cried Kate, who was always
ready for a plan. "Let's do it now."</p>

<p>So, down she sat upon the ground, and Harry
sat down in front of her.</p>

<p>Then they held a council.</p>

<p>"In the first place, we must have a President,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"That ought to be you," said Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harry, "I suppose I ought to be
President. And then we must have a Treasurer,
and I think you should be Treasurer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kate, "that would do very well.
But where could I keep the money?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Harry. "It's no use to
bother ourselves about that. We'd better get
the money first, and then see where we can put
it. I reckon it'll be spent before anybody gets
a chance to steal it. And now then, we must
have a Secretary."</p>

<p>"How would Tom Selden do for Secretary?"
asked Kate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he isn't careful enough," answered
Harry. "I think you ought to be Secretary.
You can write well, and you'll keep everything
in order."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Kate, "I'll be Secretary."</p>

<p>"I think," said Harry, "that we have now
about all the officers we want, excepting, of
course, an Engineer, and I shall be Engineer; for
I have planned out the whole thing already."</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was to be an engine,"
said Kate.</p>

<p>"Engine!" exclaimed Harry, laughing.
"That's a good one! I don't mean an engineer
of a steam-engine. What we want is a Civil
Engineer; a man who lays out railroad lines and
all that kind of thing. I'm not right sure that a
Civil Engineer does plan out telegraph lines; but
it don't make any difference what we call the
officer. He'll have to attend to putting up the
line."</p>

<p>"And do you think you can do it?" said
Kate, "I should suppose it would be a good
deal harder to be Engineer than to be President."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it will; but I've studied the
matter. I've watched the men putting up new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
wires at Hetertown, and Mr. Lyons told me all
he knew about it. It's easy enough. Very different
from building a railroad."</p>

<p>"It must be a good deal safer to build a railroad,
though," said Kate. "You don't have to
go so high up in the air."</p>

<p>"You're a little goose," said Harry, laughing
at her again.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Kate. "I'm Treasurer
and Secretary of the&mdash;What shall we call the
company, Harry? It ought to have a name."</p>

<p>"Certainly it ought," said her brother.
"How would 'The Mica Mine Telegraph Company'&mdash;No,
that wouldn't do at all. It isn't
theirs. It's ours."</p>

<p>"Call it 'The Loudon Telegraph Company,'"
said Kate.</p>

<p>"That would be nearer the thing, but it
wouldn't be very modest, though people often
do call their companies after their own names.
What do you think of 'The Akeville and Hetertown
Company'?"</p>

<p>"But it won't go to either of those places,"
said Kate. "It will only cross the creek."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right!" exclaimed Harry. "Let's call
it 'The Crooked Creek Telegraph Company.'"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Kate. "That's the very
name."</p>

<p>So the company was named.</p>

<p>"Now," said Kate, "we've got all the head
officers and the name; what do we want
next?"</p>

<p>"We want a good many other things," said
Harry. "I suppose we ought to have a Board
of Directors."</p>

<p>"Shall we be in that?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>Harry considered this question before answering
it. "I think the President ought to be in
it," he said, "but I don't know about the
Secretary and Treasurer. I think they are
not generally Directors."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kate, with a little sigh, "I
don't mind."</p>

<p>"You can be, if you want to," said Harry.
"Wait until we get the Board organized, and
I'll talk to the other fellows about it."</p>

<p>"Are they going to be all boys?" asked
Kate, quickly.</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said Harry. "We don't want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
any men in our Board. They'd be ordering us
about and doing everything themselves."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that. Will there be any
girls?"</p>

<p>"No," said Harry, a little contemptuously, it
is to be feared. "There isn't a girl in the village
who knows anything about telegraph lines,
except you."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's to be all boys, I don't believe I
would care to belong to the Board," said Kate.
"But who are we going to have?"</p>

<p>This selection of the members of the Board
of Directors seemed a little difficult at first, but
as there were so few boys to choose from it was
settled in quite a short time.</p>

<p>Tom Selden, Harvey Davis, George Purvis,
Dr. Price's youngest son, Brandeth, and Wilson
Ogden, were chosen, and these, with the addition
of Harry, made up the Board of Directors of the
Crooked Creek Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>"Well," said Kate, as the council arose and
adjourned, "I hope we'll settle the rest of our
business as easily as we have settled this part."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Company Business.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>After the selection of the Directors, all of
whom accepted their appointments with
great readiness, although, with the exception of
Tom Selden, none of them had known anything
about the company until informed by Harry of
their connection with its management, it remained
only to get subscriptions to the capital
stock, and then the construction of the line
might immediately begin.</p>

<p>Harry and Kate made out a statement of
the probable expense, and a very good statement
it was, for, as Harry had said, he had thoroughly
studied up the matter, aided by the
counsel of Mr. Lyons, the operator at Hetertown.</p>

<p>This statement, with the probable profits and
the great advantages of such a line, was written
out by Harry, and the Secretary, considering all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
clerical work to be her especial business, made
six fair copies, one of which was delivered to
each of the Board of Directors, who undertook
to solicit subscriptions.</p>

<p>A brief constitution was drawn up, and by a
clause in this instrument, one-quarter of the
profits were to go to the stockholders and the
rest to Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>The mica-mine men, when visited by Harry,
who carried a letter from his father, at first gave
the subject but little consideration, but after they
found how earnest Harry was in regard to the
matter and how, thoroughly he had studied up
the subject, theoretically and practically, under
the tuition of his friend, Mr. Lyons, they began
to think that possibly the scheme might prove
of advantage to them.</p>

<p>After a good deal of talk&mdash;enough to have
settled much more important business&mdash;they
agreed to take stock in the telegraph company,
provided Harry and his Board purchased first-class
instruments and appliances.</p>

<p>Their idea in insisting upon this was the
suggestion of their manager, that if the boys
failed in their project they might get possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the line and work it themselves. Consequently,
with a view both to the present success
of the association and their own possible acquisition
of the line, they insisted on first-class
instruments.</p>

<p>This determination discouraged Harry and
his friends, for they had not calculated upon making
the comparatively large expenditures necessary
to procure these first-class instruments.</p>

<p>They had thought to buy some cheap but
effective apparatus of which they had heard, and
which, for amateur purposes, answered very well.</p>

<p>But when the mica-mine officers agreed to
contribute a sum in proportion to the increased
capital demanded, Harry became quite hopeful,
and the other members of the Board agreed that
they had better work harder and do the thing
right while they were about it.</p>

<p>The capital of the company was fixed at one
hundred and fifty dollars, and to this the mica-mine
people agreed to subscribe fifty dollars.
They also gave a written promise to give all the
business of that kind that they might have for
a year from date, to Harry and his associates,
provided that the telegraphic service should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
always be performed promptly and to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>A contract, fixing rates, etc., was drawn up,
and Harry, the Directors, the Secretary, and the
Treasurer, all and severally signed it. This was
not actually necessary, but these officers, quite
naturally, were desirous of doing all the signing
that came in their way.</p>

<p>Private subscriptions came in more slowly.
Mr. Loudon gave fifteen dollars, and Dr. Price
contributed ten, as his son was a Director. Old
Mr. Truly Matthews subscribed five dollars, and
hoped that he should see his money back again;
but if he didn't, he supposed it would help to
keep the boys out of mischief. Small sums were
contributed by other persons in the village and
neighborhood, each of whom was furnished with
a certificate of stock proportioned to the amount
of the investment.</p>

<p>There were fifty shares issued, of three dollars
each; and Miss Jane Davis, who subscribed
one dollar and a quarter, got five-twelfths of a
share. The members of the Board, collectively,
put in thirty dollars.</p>

<p>The majority of the shareholders considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
their money as a donation to a good cause, for
of course, it was known that Aunt Matilda's support
was the object of the whole business; but
some hoped to make something out of it, and
others contributed out of curiosity to see what
sort of a telegraph the company would build, and
how it would work.</p>

<p>It was urged by some wise people that if this
money had been contributed directly to Aunt
Matilda, it would have been of much more service
to her; but other people, equally wise, said
that in that case, the money could never have
been raised.</p>

<p>The colored people, old and young, took a
great interest in the matter, and some of them
took parts of shares, which was better. Even
John William Webster took seventy-five cents
worth of stock.</p>

<p>The most astonishing subscription was one
from Aunt Matilda herself. One day she handed
to Kate a ten-cent piece&mdash;silver, old style&mdash;and
desired that that might be put into the company
for her. Where she got it, nobody knew, but
she had it, and she put it in.</p>

<p>Explanations were of no use. The fact of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the whole business being for her benefit made
no impression on her. She wanted a share in
the company, and was proud of her one-thirtieth
part of a share.</p>

<span class='caption'>A Shareholder</span>
</div>

<p>Taking them as a whole, the Board of Directors
appeared to have been very well chosen.
Tom Selden was a good fellow and a firm friend
of Harry and Kate. They might always reckon
upon his support, although he had the fault,
when matters seemed a little undecided, of giving
his advice at great length. But when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
thing was agreed upon he went to work without
a word.</p>

<p>Harvey Davis was a large, blue-eyed boy,
very quiet, with yellow hair. He was one of the
best scholars in the Akeville school, and could
throw a stone over the highest oak-tree by the
church&mdash;something no other boy in the village
could do. He made an admirable Director.</p>

<p>Dr. Price's son, Brandeth, and Wilson Ogden,
lived some miles from the village, and sometimes
one or the other of them did not get to a meeting
of the Board until the business before it had
been despatched. But they always attended
punctually if there was a horse or a mule to be
had in time, and made no trouble when they
came.</p>

<p>George Purvis lived just outside of the village.
He was a tall fellow with a little head. His
father had been in the Legislature, and George
was a great fellow to talk, and he was full of
new ideas. If Harry and Kate had not worked
out so thoroughly the plan of the company before
electing the Directors, George would have
given the rest of the Board a great deal of
trouble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>When about four-fifths of the capital stock
had been subscribed, and there was not much
likelihood of their getting any more at present,
the Board of Directors determined to go to
work.</p>

<p>Acting under the advice and counsel of Mr.
Lyons (who ought to have been a Director, but
who was not offered the position), they sent to
New York for two sets of telegraphic instruments&mdash;registers,
keys, batteries, reels, etc., etc.&mdash;one
set for each office, and for about half a
mile of wire, with the necessary office-wire, insulators,
etc.</p>

<p>This took pretty much all their capital, but
they hoped to economize a good deal in the construction
of the line, and felt quite hopeful.</p>

<p>But it seemed to be a long and dreary time
that they had to wait for the arrival of their purchases
from New York. Either Harry or one of
the other boys rode over to Hetertown every
day, and the attention they paid to the operation
of telegraphy, while waiting for the train,
was something wonderful.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing for the Board that,
on account of the sickness of the teacher, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
vacation commenced earlier than usual in Akeville
that year.</p>

<p>More than a week passed, and no word from
New York. No wonder the boys became impatient.
It had been a month, or more, since the
scheme had been first broached in the village,
and nothing had yet been done&mdash;at least, nothing
to which the boys could point as evidence
of progress.</p>

<p>The field of operation had been thoroughly
explored. The pine trees which were to serve
as telegraph poles had been selected, and contracts
had been made with "One-eyed Lewston,"
a colored preacher, who lived near the
creek on the Akeville side, and with Aunt Judy,
who had a log house on the Hetertown side, by
which these edifices were to be used as telegraphic
stations. The instruments and batteries,
when not in use, were to be locked up in
stationary cases, made by the Akeville carpenter,
after designs by Harry.</p>

<p>Of course, while waiting for the arrival of
their goods from New York, the Board met every
day. Having little real business, their discussions
were not always harmonious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>George Purvis grew discontented. Several
times he said to Brandeth Price and Harvey
Ogden that he didn't see why he shouldn't be
something more than a mere Director, and a remark
that Harvey once made, that if Harry and
Kate had not chosen to ask him to join them he
would not have been even a Director, made no
impression upon him.</p>

<p>One day, when a meeting was in session by
the roadside, near "One-eyed Lewston's" cabin&mdash;or
the Akeville telegraph station, as I should
say&mdash;George and Harry had a slight dispute,
and Purvis took occasion to give vent to some
of his dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"I don't see what you're President for, anyway,"
said he to Harry. "After the Board of
Directors had been organized it ought to have
elected all the officers."</p>

<p>"But none of you fellows knew anything
about the business," said Harry. "Kate and I
got up the company, and we needn't have had a
Board of Directors at all, if we hadn't wanted
to. If any of you boys had known anything
about telegraphs we would have given you an
office."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon you don't have to know anything
about telegraphs to be Secretary, or Treasurer
either," said George, warmly.</p>

<p>"No," answered Harry, "but you've got to
know how to keep accounts and to be careful
and particular."</p>

<p>"Like your sister Kate, I suppose," said
George, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Yes, like Kate," answered Harry.</p>

<p>"I'd be ashamed of myself," said George,
"if I couldn't get a better Secretary or Treasurer
than a girl. I don't see what a girl is doing
in the company, anyway. The right kind of a
girl wouldn't be seen pushing herself in among a
lot of boys that don't want her."</p>

<p>Without another word, the President of the
Crooked Creek Telegraph Company arose and
offered battle to George Purvis. The contest
was a severe one, for Purvis was a tall fellow, but
Harry was as tough as the sole of your boot, and
he finally laid his antagonist on the flat of his
back in the road.</p>

<p>George arose, put on his hat, dusted off his
clothes, and resigned his position in the Board.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Principally Concerning Kate.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>During all this work of soliciting subscriptions,
ordering instruments and batteries,
and leasing stations, Kate had kept pretty
much in the background. True, she had not
been idle. She had covered a great deal of
paper with calculations, and had issued certificates
of stock, all in her own plain handwriting,
to those persons who had put money into the
treasury of the company. And she had received
all that money, had kept accurate account of it,
and had locked it up in a little box which was
kindly kept for her in the iron safe owned by
Mr. Darby, the storekeeper.</p>

<p>When the money was all drawn out and sent
to New York, her duties became easier.</p>

<p>School had closed, as has been before stated,
and although Kate had home duties and some
home studies, she had plenty of time for outdoor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
life. But now she almost always had to
enjoy that life alone, if we except the company
of Rob, who generally kept faithfully near her
so long as she saw fit to walk, but when she
stopped to rest or to pursue some of her botanical
or entomological studies he was very apt to
wander off on his own account. He liked to
keep moving.</p>

<p>One of her favorite resorts was what was
called the "Near Woods," a piece of forest land
not far from Mr. Loudon's house, and within
calling distance of several dwellings and negro
cabins. She visited Aunt Matilda nearly every
day; but the woods around her cabin were
principally pine, and pine forests are generally
very sombre.</p>

<p>But the "Near Woods" were principally of
oak and hickory, with dogwood, sweet gum, and
other smaller trees here and there; and there
were open spots where the sun shone in and
where flowers grew and the insects loved to
come, as well as heavily shaded places under
grand old trees.</p>

<p>She thoroughly enjoyed herself in a wood
like this. She did not feel in the least lonely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
although she would have found herself sadly
alone in a busy street of a great city.</p>

<p>Here, she was acquainted with everything
she saw. There was company for her on every
side. She had not been in the habit of passing
the trees and the bushes, the lichens and ferns,
and the flowers and mosses as if they were
merely people hurrying up and down the street.
She had stopped and made their acquaintance,
and now she knew them all, and they
were her good friends, excepting a few, such as
the poison-vines, and here and there a plant or
reptile, with which she was never on terms of
intimacy.</p>

<p>She would often sit and swing on a low-bending
grape-vine, that hung between two lofty
trees, sometimes singing, and sometimes listening
to the insects that hummed around her, and
all the while as happy a Kate as any Kate in the
world.</p>

<p>It was here, on the grape-vine swing, that
Harry found her, the day after his little affair
with George Purvis.</p>

<p>"Why, Harry!" she cried, "I thought you
were having a meeting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's nothing to meet about," said Harry,
seating himself on a big moss-covered root near
Kate's swing.</p>

<p>"There will be when the telegraph things
come," said Kate.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there'll be enough to do then, but
it seems as if they were never coming. And I've
been thinking about something, Kate. It strikes
me that, perhaps, it would be better for you to
hold only one office."</p>

<p>"Why? Don't I do well enough?" asked
Kate, quickly, stopping herself very suddenly in
her swinging.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! you do better than any one else
could. But, you see, the other fellows&mdash;I mean
the Board&mdash;may think that some of them ought
to have an office. I'd give them one of mine,
but none of them would do for Engineer. They
don't know enough about the business."</p>

<p>"Which office would you give up, if you were
me?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd give up the Secretaryship, of
course," said Harry. "Nobody but you must
be Treasurer. Harvey Davis would make a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
good Secretary, considering that there's so little
writing to do now."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Kate, "let Harvey be
Secretary."</p>

<p>There was no bitterness or reproachfulness in
Kate's words, but she looked a little serious, and
began to swing herself very vigorously. It was
evident that she felt this resignation of her favorite
office much more deeply than she chose to
express. And no wonder. She had done all
the work; she had taken a pride in doing her
work well, and now, when the company was
about to enter upon its actual public life, she was
to retire into the background. For a Treasurer
had not much to do, especially now that there
was so little money. There was scarcely a paper
for the Treasurer to sign. But the Secretary&mdash;Well,
there was no use of thinking any more
about it. No doubt Harry knew what was best.
He was with the Board every day, and she
scarcely ever met the members.</p>

<p>Harry saw that Kate was troubled, but he
did not know what to say, and so he whittled at
the root on which he was sitting.</p>

<p>"I should think, Harry," said Kate directly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
"that George Purvis would want to be Secretary.
He's just the kind of a boy to like to be an
officer of some kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, he can't be an officer," said Harry,
still whittling at the root. "He has resigned."</p>

<p>"George Purvis resigned!" exclaimed Kate.
"Why, what did he do that for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we didn't agree," said Harry; "and
we're better off without him. We have Directors
enough as it is. Five is a very good
number. There can't be a tie vote with five
members in the Board."</p>

<p>Kate suspected that something had happened
that she was not to be told. But she
asked no questions.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of swinging and whittling,
in which neither of them said anything, Kate
got out of her grape-vine swing and picked up
her hat from the ground, and Harry jumped up
and whistled for Rob.</p>

<p>As they walked home together, Kate said:</p>

<p>"Harry, I think I'd better resign as Treasurer.
Perhaps the officers ought all to be
boys."</p>

<p>"Look here, Kate," said Harry; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
stopped as he spoke, "I'm not going to have
anybody else as Treasurer. If you resign that
office I'll smash the company!"</p>

<p>Of course, after that there was nothing more
to be said, and Kate remained Treasurer of the
Crooked Creek Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>Before very long, of course, she heard the
particulars of George Purvis's resignation. She
did not say much about it, but she was very glad
that it was not Harry who had been whipped.</p>

<p>The next morning, quite early&mdash;the birds
and the negroes had been up some time, but
everybody in Mr. Loudon's house was still
sleeping soundly&mdash;Harry, who had a small room
at the front of the house, was awakened by the
noise of a horse galloping wildly up to the front
gate, and by hearing his name shouted out at
the top of a boy's voice.</p>

<p>The boy was Tom Selden, and he shouted:</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry! Harry Loudon! Hello, there!
The telegraph things have come!"</p>

<p>Harry gave one bound. He jerked on his
clothes quicker than you could say the multiplication
table, and he rushed down stairs and into
the front yard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>It was actually so! The instruments and
batteries and everything, all packed up in boxes&mdash;Tom
couldn't say how many boxes&mdash;had come
by a late train, and Mr. Lyons had sent word
over to his house last night, and he had been over
there this morning by daybreak and had seen
one of the boxes, and it was directed, all right, to
the Crooked Creek Telegraph Company, and&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a good deal more intelligence, it
appeared, but it wasn't easy to make it out, for
Harry was asking fifty questions, and Kate was
calling out from one of the windows, and Dick
Ford and half-a-dozen other negro boys were
running up and shouting to each other that the
things had come. Mr. Loudon came out to see
what all the excitement was about, and he had
to be told everything by Tom and Harry, both
at once; and Rob and Blinks were barking, and
there was hubbub enough.</p>

<p>Harry shouted to one of the boys to saddle
Selim, and when the horse was brought around
in an incredibly short time&mdash;four negroes having
clapped on his saddle and bridle&mdash;Harry ran into
the house to get his hat; but just as he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
bounced out again, his mother appeared at the
front door.</p>

<p>"Harry!" she cried, "you're not going off
without your breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want any breakfast, mother,"
he shouted.</p>

<p>"But you cannot go without your breakfast.
You'll be sick."</p>

<p>"But just think!" expostulated Harry.
"The things have been there all night."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference," said Mrs. Loudon.
"You must have your breakfast first."</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon now put in a word, and Selim
was led back to the stable.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must," said poor Harry,
with an air of resignation. "Come in, Tom, and
have something to eat."</p>

<p>The news spread rapidly. Harvey Davis
was soon on hand, and by the time breakfast
was over, nearly every body in the village knew
that the telegraph things had come.</p>

<p>Harry and Tom did not get off as soon as
they expected, for Mr. Loudon advised them to
take the spring-wagon&mdash;for they would need it
to haul their apparatus to the telegraphic stations&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the horse had to be harnessed, and
the cases which were to protect the instruments,
when not in use, were to be brought from the
carpenter-shop, and so it seemed very late before
they started.</p>

<p>Just as they were ready to go, up galloped
Brandeth Price and Wilson Ogden. So away
they all went together, two of the Board in the
wagon and three on horseback.</p>

<p>Kate stood at the front gate looking after
them. Do what she would, she could not help
a tear or two rising to her eyes. Mr. Loudon
noticed her standing there, and he went down
to her.</p>

<p>"Never mind Kate," said he. "I told them
not to unpack the things until they had hauled
them to the creek; and I'll take you over to
Aunt Judy's in the buggy. We'll get there by
the time the boys arrive."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">The Arrival.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When Kate and her father reached Aunt
Judy's cabin, the boys had not yet arrived,
but they were anxiously expected by about a
dozen colored people of various ages and sizes,
and by two or three white men, who were sitting
under the trees waiting to see the "telegraph
come."</p>

<p>Telegraph apparatus and wires were not at
all novel in that part of the country, but this
was to be the first time that anything of the
kind had been set up in that neighborhood, in
those familiar old woods about Crooked Creek.</p>

<p>And then it must be remembered, too, that
most of these interested people were "stockholders."
That was something entirely novel,
and it is no wonder that they were anxious to
see their property.</p>

<p>"I hopes, Mah'sr John," said Aunt Judy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
to Mr. Loudon, "dat dem dar merchines ain't
a-goin' to bust up when dey're lef' h'yar all alone
by theyselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no danger, Aunt Judy," said Mr.
Loudon, "if you don't meddle with them. But
I suppose you can't do that, if the boys are
going to case them up, as they told me they
intended doing."</p>

<p>"Why, bress your soul, Mah'sr John, ye
needn't be 'fraid o' my techin' 'em off. I
wouldn't no more put a finger on 'em dan I'd
pull de trigger ov a hoss pistol."</p>

<p>"There isn't really any danger in having
these instruments in the house, is there, father?"
asked Kate, when she and Mr. Loudon
had stepped out of the cabin where Aunt Judy
was busy sweeping and "putting things to
rights" in honor of the expected arrival.</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances," said
Mr. Loudon. "If the boys are careful to disconnect
the instruments and the wires when they
leave the cabins, there is no more danger than
there would be in a brass clock. But if they
leave the wires attached to the instruments,
lightning might be attracted into the cabins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
during a thunder-storm, and Aunt Judy might
find the 'merchines' quite as dangerous as a
horse-pistol."</p>

<p>"But they mustn't leave the wires that way,"
said Kate. "I sha'n't let Harry forget it.
Why, it would be awful to have Aunt Judy and
poor old Lewston banged out of their beds in
the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Mr. Loudon; "but
the boys&mdash;I am sure about Harry&mdash;understand
their business, to that extent, at least. I don't
apprehend any accidents of that kind."</p>

<p>Kate was just about to ask her father if he
feared accidents of any kind, when a shout was
heard from the negroes by the roadside.</p>

<p>"Dar dey come!" sang out half-a-dozen
voices, and, sure enough, there was the wagon
slowly turning an angle of the road, with the
mounted members of the Board riding close by
its side.</p>

<p>All now was bustle and eagerness. Everybody
wanted to do something, and everybody
wanted to see. The wagon was driven up as
close to the cabin as the trees would allow; the
boys jumped down from their seats and saddles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the horses' bridles were fastened to branches overhead;
white, black, and yellow folks clustered
around the wagon; and some twenty hands
were proffered to aid in carrying the load into
the cabin.</p>

<p>Harry was the grand director of affairs. He
had a good, loud voice, and it served him well
on this important occasion.</p>

<p>"Look out, there!" he cried. "Don't any
of you touch a box or anything, till I tell you
what to do. They're not all to go into Aunt
Judy's cabin. Some things are to go across the
creek to Lewston's house. Here, John William
and Gregory, take this table and carry it in carefully;
and you, Dick, take that chair. Don't be
in a hurry. We're not going to open the boxes
out here."</p>

<p>"Why, Harry," cried Kate, "I didn't know
there were to be tables and chairs."</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I didn't think of it either,"
said Harry; "but we must have something to
put our instruments on, and something to sit on
while we work them. Mr. Lyons reminded us
that we'd have to have them, and we got these
in Hetertown. Had to go to three places to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
them all, and one's borrowed, anyway. Look
out there, you, Bobby! you can't carry a chair.
Get down off that wheel before you break your
neck.</p>

<p>"Lor' bress your heart, Mah'sr Harry, is ye
got a bed? I never did 'spect ye was a-goin' to
bring furniture," cried Aunt Judy, her eyes rolling
up and down in astonishment and delight.
"Dat's a pooty cheer. Won't hurt a body to sot
in dat cheer when you all ain't a-usin' it, will it?"</p>

<p>"Blow you right through the roof, if you set
on the trigger," said Tom Selden; "so mind
you're careful, Aunt Judy."</p>

<p>"Now, then," cried Harry, "carry in this
box. Easy, now. We'll take all the wire over
on the other side. You see, Tom, that they
leave the wire in the wagon. Do you know,
father, that we forgot to bring a hammer or anything
to open these boxes?"</p>

<p>"There's a hammer under the seat of the
buggy. One of you boys run and get it."</p>

<p>At the word, two negro boys rushed for the
buggy and the hammer.</p>

<p>"A screw-driver would do better," said Harvey
Davis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"One-eyed Lewston's got a screw-driver,"
said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Dar Lewston!" cried John William Webster.
"Dar he! Jist comin' ober de bridge."</p>

<p>"Shet up!" cried Aunt Judy. "Don't 'spect
he got him screw-driber in him breeches pocket,
does ye? Why don' ye go 'long and git it?"</p>

<p>And away went John William and two other
boys for the screw-driver.</p>

<p>In spite of so many cooks, the broth was not
spoiled; and after a reasonable time the beautifully
polished instruments were displayed to
view on the table in Aunt Judy's cabin.</p>

<p>Everybody looked with all their eyes. Even
Mr. Loudon, who had often examined telegraphic
apparatus, took a great interest in this,
and the negroes thought there was never anything
so wonderful. Especially were those delighted
who owned stock.</p>

<p>"Some o' dat dar's mine," said a shiny-faced
black boy. "Wonder ef dat little door-knob's
my sheer."</p>

<p>"You go 'long, dar," said Dick Ford, giving
him a punch in the ribs with his elbow. "Dat
little shiny screw's 'bout as much as you own."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the members of the Board, they were
radiant. There was the telegraphic apparatus
(or a part of it) of the Crooked Creek Telegraph
Company, and here were the officers!</p>

<p>Each one of them, except Brandeth Price,
explained some portion of the instruments to
some of the bystanders.</p>

<p>As for Brandeth, he had not an idea what was
to be done with anything. But he had a vote
in the Board. He never forgot that.</p>

<p>"Can't ye work it a little, Mah'sr Harry!"
asked Gregory Montague.</p>

<p>"Dat's so!" cried a dozen voices. "Jist let's
see her run a little, Mah'sr Harry, please!"
Even Kate wanted to see how the things worked.</p>

<p>Harry explained that he couldn't "run it"
until he had arranged the battery and had made
a great many preparations, and he greatly disappointed
the assembly by informing them that
all that was to be done that day was to put the
instruments in their respective houses (or stations,
as the boys now began to call the cabins),
and to put up the cases which were to protect
them when not in use. These cases were like
small closets, with movable tops, and there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
great fear that they would not fit over the tables
that had been brought from Hetertown.</p>

<p>On the next day, Mr. Lyons had promised
to come over and show them how to begin the
work.</p>

<p>"There'll be plenty for you fellows to do,"
said Harry, "when we put up the wires."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Constructing the Line.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The next day was a day of hard work for
the Board of Managers. Mr. Lyons, who
took the greatest interest in the enterprise, got
another operator to take his place at the Hetertown
station, and came over to help the boys.</p>

<p>Under his direction, and with his help, they
arranged the instruments and the batteries, sunk
the ground-wires, and, in a general way, put the
office-apparatus in working order. When night
came, there were still some things that remained
to be done in the two stations, but the main
part of the office arrangements had been satisfactorily
concluded, under Mr. Lyons's supervision.</p>

<p>Now, it only remained to put up the wire;
and this was a piece of work that interested
the whole neighborhood. There had been lookers-on
enough while the instruments were being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
put in working order, but the general mind did
not comprehend the mechanism and uses of
registers and keys and batteries.</p>

<p>Any one, however, could understand how a
telegraphic wire was put up. And what was
more, quite a number of persons thought they
knew exactly how it ought to be put up, and
made no scruple of saying so.</p>

<p>Tony Kirk was on hand&mdash;as it was not turkey
season&mdash;and he made himself quite useful.
Having had some experience in working under
surveyors, he gave the boys a good deal of valuable
advice, and, what was of quite as much
service, he proved very efficient in quieting the
zeal of some ambitious, but undesirable, volunteer
assistants.</p>

<p>Certain straight pine-trees, at suitable distances
from each other, and, as nearly as possible,
on a right line between the two cabins, were
selected as poles, and their tops were cut off
about twenty-five feet from the ground. All
trees and branches that would be apt to interfere
with the wires were cut down, out of the
way.</p>

<p>At one time&mdash;for this matter of putting up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the wire occupied several days&mdash;there were ten
or twelve negro men engaged in cutting down
trees, and in topping and trimming telegraph
poles.</p>

<p>Each one of these men received forty cents
per day from the company, and found themselves.
It is probable that if the Board had
chosen to pay but twenty cents, there would
have been quite as many laborers, for this was
novel and very interesting work, and several
farm-hands threw up their situations for a day
or two and came over to "cut fur de telegraph."</p>

<p>When the poles were all ready on each side
of the creek, the insulators, or glass knobs, to
which the wires were to be attached, were to be
fastened to them, a foot or two from the top.</p>

<p>This was to be done under Harry's direction,
who had studied up the theory of the operation
from his books and under Mr. Lyons.</p>

<p>But the actual work proved very difficult.
The first few insulators Harry put up himself.
He was a good climber, but not being provided
with the peculiar "climbers" used by the men
who put up telegraph wires, he found it very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
hard to stay up at the top of a pole after he had
got there, especially as he needed both hands to
nail to the tree the wooden block to which the
insulator was attached.</p>

<p>In fact, he made a bad business of it, and
the insulators he put up in this way looked
"shackling poorly," to say nothing of his trowsers,
which suffered considerably every time he
slipped part way down a pole.</p>

<p>But here Tony Kirk again proved himself a
friend in need. He got a wagon, and drove
four miles to a farm-house, where there was
a long, light ladder. This he borrowed, and
brought over to the scene of operation.</p>

<p>This ladder was not quite long enough to
reach to the height at which Harry had fastened
his insulators, but it was generally agreed that
there was no real necessity for putting them up
so high.</p>

<p>The ladder was arranged by Tony in a very
ingenious way. He laid it on the ground, with
the top at the root of the tree to be climbed.
Then he fastened a piece of telegraph wire to
one side of the ladder, passed it loosely around
the tree, and fastened it to the other side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Then, as the ladder was gradually raised, the
wire slipped along up the tree, and when the
ladder was in position it could not fall, although
it might shake and totter a little. However,
strong arms at the bottom held it pretty steady,
and Harry was enabled to nail on his insulators
with comparative ease, and in a very satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>After a while, Tony took his place, and being
a fellow whom it was almost impossible to tire,
he finished the whole business without assistance.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that when Tony mounted
the ladder, he dispensed with the wire safeguard,
depending upon the carefulness of the two
negro men who held the ladder from below.</p>

<p>The next thing was to put up the wire itself,
and this was done in rather a bungling manner,
if this wire were compared with that of ordinary
telegraph lines.</p>

<p>It was found quite impossible to stretch the
wire tightly between the poles, as the necessary
appliances were wanting.</p>

<p>Various methods of tightening were tried,
but none were very successful; and the wire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
hung in curves, some greater and some less,
between the poles.</p>

<p>But what did it matter? There was plenty
of wire, and the wind had not much chance to
blow it about, as it was protected by the neighboring
treetops.</p>

<p>There was no trouble in carrying the wire over
the creek, as the bridge was very near, and as
trees close to each bank had been chosen for
poles, and as the creek was not very wide, the
wire approached nearer to a straight line where
it passed over the water than it did anywhere
else.</p>

<p>At last all was finished. The "main line"
wire was attached to the copper office-wire.
The batteries were charged, the register was
arranged with its paper strip, and everything
was ready for the transmission of messages
across Crooked Creek.</p>

<p>At least, the Board hoped that everything was
ready. It could not be certain until a trial was
made.</p>

<p>The trial was made, and everybody in the
neighborhood, who could get away from home
came to see it made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry was at the instrument on the Akeville
side, and Mr. Lyons (the second operator
of the company had not been appointed) attended
to the other end of the line, taking his
seat at the table in Aunt Judy's cabin, where
Mr. and Mrs. Loudon, Kate, and as many other
persons as the room would hold, were congregated.</p>

<p>As President of the company, Harry claimed
the privilege of sending the first message.</p>

<p>Surrounded by the Board, and a houseful of
people besides, he took his seat at the instrument,
and after looking about him to see if
everything was in proper order, he touched the
key to "call" the operator at the other end.</p>

<p>But no answer came. Something was wrong.
Harry tried again, but still no answer. He
jumped up and examined the instrument and
the battery.</p>

<p>Everybody had something to say, and some
advice to give.</p>

<p>Even old "One-eyed Lewston" pushed his
way up to Harry, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mah'sr Harry! Ef you want to grease
her, I got some hog's-lard up dar on dat shelf."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>But Harry soon thought he found where the
fault lay, and, adjusting a screw or two, he tried
the key again. This time his call was answered.</p>

<p>"Click! click! click! click!" went the instrument.</p>

<p>Wild with excitement, everybody crowded
closer to Harry, who, with somewhat nervous
fingers, slowly sent over the line of the Crooked
Creek Telegraph Company its first message.</p>

<p>When received on the other side, and translated
from the dots and dashes of the register, it
read thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To Kate.&mdash;Ho-ow are you?</p></div>

<p>Directly the answer came swiftly from the
practised fingers of Mr. Lyons:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To Harry.&mdash;I am very well.</p></div>

<p>This message had no sooner been received
and announced than Harry, followed by every
one else, rushed out of the house, and there, on
the other side of the creek, he saw his father
and mother and Kate and all the rest hurrying
out of Aunt Judy's cabin.</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon waved his hat and shouted;
"Hurrah!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry and the Board answered with a wild
"Hurrah!"</p>

<p>Then everybody took it up, and the woods
rang with, "Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"</p>

<p>The Crooked Creek Telegraph Line was a
success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">An Important Meeting of the Board.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Now that the telegraphic line was built, and
in good working order, it became immediately
necessary to appoint another operator, for
it was quite evident that Harry could not work
both ends of the line.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to appoint an operator,
but not so easy for such person to work the instruments.
In fact, Harry was the only individual
in the company or the neighborhood who
understood the duties of a telegrapher, and his
opportunities for practice had been exceedingly
limited.</p>

<p>It was determined to educate an operator,
and Harvey Davis was chosen as the most suitable
individual for the position. So, day after
day was spent by Harry and Harvey, the one
in the cabin of "One-eyed Lewston," and the
other in that of Aunt Judy, in steady, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
often unsatisfactory, practice in the transmission
and reading of telegraphic messages.</p>

<p>Of course, great interest was taken in their
progress, and some members of the Board were
generally present at one or the other of the stations.
Kate often came over to Aunt Judy's
cabin, and almost always there were other persons
present, each of whom, whenever there was
a chance, was eager to send a telegraphic message
gratis, even if it were only across Crooked
Creek.</p>

<p>Sometimes neither Harry nor Harvey could
make out what the other one was trying to say,
and then they would run out of the station and
go down to the bank of the creek and shout
across for explanations. A great many more
intelligible messages were sent in this way, for
the first few days, than were transmitted over
the wire.</p>

<p>Tony Kirk remarked, after a performance of
this kind, "It 'pears to me that it wasn't no use
to put up that ar wire, fur two fellows could a
been app'inted, one to stand on each side o' the
creek, and holler the messages across."</p>

<p>But, of course, such a proceeding would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
have been extremely irregular. Tony was not
accustomed to the strict requirements of business.</p>

<p>Sometimes the messages were extremely
complicated. For instance, Harry, one day
about noon, carefully telegraphed the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I would not go home. Perhaps you can get something to
eat from Aunt Judy.</p></div>

<p>As Harvey translated this, it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I would gph go rapd gradsvlt bodgghip rda goqbsjcm eat
dkpx Aunt Judy.</p></div>

<p>In answer to this, Harvey attempted to send
the following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What do you mean by eating Aunt Judy?</p></div>

<p>But Harry read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whatt a xdll mean rummmlgigdd Ju!</p></div>

<p>Harry thought, of course, that this seemed
like a reflection on his motives in proposing
that Harvey could ask Aunt Judy to give him
something to eat, and so, of course, there had to
be explanations.</p>

<p>After a time, however the operators became
much more expert, and although Harvey was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
always a little slow, he was very careful and
very patient&mdash;most excellent qualities in an
operator upon such a line.</p>

<p>The great desire now, not only among the
officers of the company, but with many other
folks in Akeville and the neighborhood, was to
see the creek "up," so that travel across it
might be suspended, and the telegraphic business
commence.</p>

<p>To be sure, there might be other interests
with which a rise in the creek would interfere,
but they, of course, were considered of small
importance, compared with the success of an
enterprise like this.</p>

<p>But the season was very dry, and the creek
very low. There were places where a circus-man
could have jumped across it with all his
pockets full of telegraphic messages.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the affairs of the company
did not look very flourishing. The men who
assisted in the construction of the line had not
been paid in full, and they wanted their money.
Kate reported that the small sum which had
been appropriated out of the capital stock for
the temporary support of Aunt Matilda was all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
gone. This report she made in her capacity as
a special committee of one, appointed (by herself)
to attend to the wants of Aunt Matilda. As
the Treasurer of the company, she also reported
that there was not a cent in its coffers.</p>

<p>In this emergency, Harry called a meeting
of the Board.</p>

<p>It met, as this was an important occasion, in
Davis's corn-house, fortunately now empty. This
was a cool, shady edifice, and, though rather
small, was very well ventilated. The meetings
had generally been held under some big tree, or
in various convenient spots in the woods near the
creek, but nothing of that kind would be proper
for such a meeting as this, especially as Kate, as
Treasurer, was to be present. This was her first
appearance at a meeting of the Board. The
boys sat on the corn-house floor, which had been
nicely swept out by John William Webster, and
Kate had a chair on the grass, just outside of the
door. There she could hear and see with great
comfort without "settin' on the floor with a
passel of boys," as Miss Eliza Davis, who furnished
the chair, elegantly expressed it.</p>

<p>When the meeting had been called to order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
(and John William, who evinced a desire to
hang around and find out what was going on,
had been discharged from further attendance on
the Board, or, in other words, had been ordered
to "clear out"), and the minutes of the last
meeting had been read, and the Treasurer had
read her written report, and the Secretary had
read his, an air of despondency seemed to settle
upon the assembly.</p>

<p>An empty corn-house seemed, as Tom Selden
remarked, a very excellent place for them
to meet.</p>

<p>The financial condition of the company was
about as follows:</p>

<p>It owed "One-eyed Lewston" and Aunt
Judy one dollar each for one month's rent of
their homesteads as stations, the arrangement
having been made about the time the instruments
were ordered.</p>

<p>It owed four dollars and twenty cents to the
wood-cutters who worked on the construction
of the line, and two dollars and a half for other
assistance at that time.</p>

<p>("Wish we had done it all ourselves," said
Wilson Ogden.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>It owed three dollars, balance on furniture
procured at Hetertown. (It also owed one chair,
borrowed.)</p>

<p>It owed, for spikes and some other hardware
procured at the store, one dollar and sixty
cents.</p>

<p>In addition to this, it owed John William
Webster, who had been employed as a sort of
general agent to run errands and clean up things,
seventy-five cents&mdash;balance of salary&mdash;and he
wanted his money.</p>

<p>To meet these demands, as was before remarked,
they had nothing.</p>

<p>Fortunately nothing was owing for Aunt
Matilda's support, Harry and Kate having from
the first determined never to run in debt on her
account.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, poor Aunt Matilda's affairs
were never in so bad a condition. The
great interest which Kate and Harry had taken
in the telegraph line had prevented them from
paying much attention to their ordinary methods
of making money, and now that the company's
appropriation was spent, there seemed to be no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
immediate method of getting any money for the
old woman's present needs.</p>

<p>This matter was not strictly the business
of the Board, but they nevertheless considered
it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Last Resort.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The Board was fully agreed that something
must be done to relieve Aunt Matilda's
present necessities, but what to do did not seem
very clear.</p>

<p>Wilson Ogden proposed issuing some kind
of scrip or bonds, redeemable in six or seven
months, when the company should be on a paying
basis.</p>

<p>"I believe," said he, "that Mr. Darby would
take these bonds at the store for groceries and
things, and we might pay him interest, besides
redeeming the bonds when they came due."</p>

<p>This was rather a startling proposition. No
one had suspected Wilson of having such a
financial mind.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Harry, "how that
would work. Mr. Darby might not be willing
to take the bonds; and besides that, it seems to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
me that the company ought not to make any
more promises to pay when it owes so much
already."</p>

<p>"But you see that would be different," said
Wilson. "What we owe now we ought to pay
right away. The bonds would not have to be
paid for ever so long."</p>

<p>"That may be pretty sharp reasoning," remarked
Tom Selden, "but I can't see into it."</p>

<p>"It would be all the same as running in
debt for Aunt Matilda, wouldn't it?" asked
Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Wilson, "a kind of running in
debt, but not exactly the common way. You
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if it's any kind at all, I'm against it,"
said Kate, quickly. "We're not going to support
Aunt Matilda that way."</p>

<p>This settled the matter. To be sure, Kate
had no vote in the Board; but this was a subject
in which she had what might be considered
to be a controlling interest, and the bond
project was dropped.</p>

<p>Various schemes were now proposed, but
there were objections to all of them. Everyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
was agreed that it was very unfortunate that
this emergency should have arisen just at this
time, because as soon as the company got into
good working order, and the creek had been up
a few times it was probable that Aunt Matilda
would really have more money than she would
absolutely need.</p>

<p>"You ought to look out, Harry and Kate,"
said Harvey Davis, "that all the darkies she
knows don't come and settle down on her and
live off her. She's a great old woman for having
people around her, even now."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kate, "she has a right to have
company if she wants to, and can afford it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom Selden; "but having company's
very different from having a lot of good-for-nothing
darkies eating her out of house and
home."</p>

<p>"She won't have anything of that sort," said
Harry. "I'll see that her money's spent right."</p>

<p>"But if it's her money," said Harvey, "she
can spend it as she chooses."</p>

<p>A discussion here followed as to the kind of
influence that ought to be brought to bear upon
Aunt Matilda to induce her to make a judicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
use of her income; but Harry soon interrupted
the arguments, with the remark that they had
better not bother themselves about what Aunt
Matilda should do with her money when she got
it, until they had found out some way of preventing
her from starving to death while she was
waiting for it.</p>

<p>This was evidently good common sense, but
it put a damper on the spirits of the Board.</p>

<p>There was nothing new to be said on the
main question, and it was now growing toward
supper-time; so the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>On their way home, Harry said to Kate,
"Has Aunt Matilda anything to eat at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; she has enough for her supper to-night,
and for breakfast, too, if nobody comes to
see her. But that's all."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Harry.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is all right," replied Kate.
"What's two meals, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"Two meals are very good things, provided
you don't take them both at once," said Harry.
And he began to whistle.</p>

<p>The next day, Harry went off and staid until
dinner-time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate could not imagine where he had gone.
He was not with the Board, she knew, for Harvey
Davis had been inquiring for him.</p>

<p>Just before dinner he made his appearance.</p>

<p>Kate was in the house, but he hurried her
out under the catalpa-tree.</p>

<p>"Look here!" said he, putting his hand in
his pocket and pulling out several "greenbacks."
"I reckon that'll keep Aunt Matilda until the
company begins to make money."</p>

<p>Kate opened her eyes their very widest.</p>

<p>"Why, where on earth did you get all that
money, Harry? Is it yours?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's mine," said Harry. "I sold
my gun."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry!" and the tears actually came
into Kate's eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't cry about it," said Harry.
"There's nothing to shoot now; and when we
get rich I can buy it back again, or get another."</p>

<p>"Got rich!" said Kate. "I don't see how
we're going to do that; especially when it's such
dreadfully dry weather."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Quandary.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>About a week after the meeting of the
Board in the Davis corn-house, old Miles,
the mail-rider, came galloping up to Mr. Loudon's
front gate. The family were at breakfast,
but Harry and Kate jumped up and ran to the
door, when they saw Miles coming, with his saddle-bags
flapping behind him. No one had ever
before seen Miles ride so fast. A slow trot, or
rather a steady waddle, was the pace that he
generally preferred.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mah'sr Harry," shouted old Miles,
"de creek's up! Can't git across dar, no how?"</p>

<p>This glorious news for the Crooked Creek
Telegraph Company was, indeed, true! There
had been wet weather for several days, and
although the rain-fall had not been great in the
level country about Akeville, it had been very
heavy up among the hills; and the consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
was, that the swollen hill-streams, or "branches"
as they are called in that part of the country, had
rushed down and made Crooked Creek rise in a
hurry. It seemed to be always ready to rise in
this way, whenever it had a chance.</p>

<p>Now the company could go to work! Now
it could show the world, or as much of the world
as chose to take notice, the advantages of
having a telegraph line across a creek in time
of freshets.</p>

<p>Harry was all alive with excitement. He
sent for Harvey Davis, and had old Selim saddled
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"H'yar's de letters and telegrums, Mah'sr
Harry," said Miles, unlocking his saddle-bags
and taking out a bundle of letters and some telegrams,
written on the regular telegraphic blanks
and tied up in a little package.</p>

<p>As the mail was a private one, and old Miles
was known to be perfectly honest, he carried the
key and attended personally to the locking and
unlocking of his saddle-bags.</p>

<p>"But I don't want the letters, Miles," said
Harry. "I've nothing to do with them. Give
me the telegrams, and I'll send them across."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't want de letters?" cried Miles, his
eyes and mouth wide open in astonishment.
"Why, I can't carry de letters ober no mor'n I
kin de telegrams."</p>

<p>"Well, neither can I," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Den what's de use ob dat wire?" exclaimed
Miles. "I thought you uns ud send de letters
an' all ober dat wire? Dere's lots more letters
dan telegrums."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Harry, hurriedly; "but
we can't send letters. Give the telegraphic
messages, and you go back to the mines with
the letters, and if there's anything in them that
they want to telegraph, let them write out the
messages, and you bring them over to Lewston's
cabin."</p>

<p>Harry took the telegrams, and old Miles rode
off, very much disturbed in his mind. His confidence
in the utility of the telegraph company
was wofully shaken.</p>

<p>By this time Harvey had arrived on a mule,
and the two operators dashed away as fast as
their animals would carry them.</p>

<p>As they galloped along Harry shouted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Harvey, who kept ahead most of the time, for
his mule was faster than Selim:</p>

<p>"Hello, Harvey! If Miles couldn't get across,
how can either of us go over?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon the creek isn't much up
yet," answered Harvey. "Miles is easily frightened."</p>

<p>So, on they rode, hoping for the best; but
when they reached the creek they saw, to their
dismay, that the water was much higher already
than it usually rose in the summer-time. The
low grounds on each side were overflowed, and
nothing could be seen of the bridge but the tops
of two upright timbers near its middle.</p>

<p>It was certainly very unfortunate that both
the operators were on the same side of the
stream!</p>

<p>"This is a pretty piece of business," cried
Harry. "I didn't expect the creek to get up so
quickly as this. I was down here yesterday, and
it hadn't risen at all. I tell you, Harvey, you
ought to live on the other side."</p>

<p>"Or else you ought," said Harvey.</p>

<p>"No," said Harry; "this is my station."</p>

<p>Harvey had no answer ready for this, but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
they were hurriedly fastening Selim and the
mule to trees near Lewston's cabin, he said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Lyons may come down and
work the other end of the line."</p>

<p>"He can't get off," said Harry. "He has
his own office to attend to. And, besides, that
wouldn't do. We must work our own line,
especially at the very beginning. It would look
nice&mdash;now, wouldn't it?&mdash;to wait until Mr.
Lyons could come over from Hetertown before
we could commence operations!"</p>

<p>"Well, what can we do?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"Why, one of us must get across, somehow."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it's going to be done," said
Harvey, as they ran down to the edge of the
water. "I reckon we'll have to holler our messages
across, as Tony said; only there isn't anybody
to holler to."</p>

<p>"I don't know how it's to be done either,"
said Harry; "but one of us must get over, some
way or other."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we wade to the bridge," asked
Harvey, "and then walk over on it? I don't
believe it's more than up to our waists on the
bridge."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't know how deep it is," said Harry;
"and when you get to the bridge, ten to
one more than half the planks have been floated
off, and you'd go slump to the bottom of the
creek before you knew it. There's no way but
to get a boat."</p>

<p>"I don't know where you're going to find
one," said Harvey. "There's a boat up at the
mill-pond, but you couldn't get it out and down
here in much less than a day."</p>

<p>"John Walker has his boat afloat again,"
said Harry, "but that's over on the other side.
What a nuisance it is that there isn't anybody
over there! If we didn't want 'em, there'd be
about sixty or seventy darkies hanging about
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Harvey, "not so many as
that; not over forty-seven."</p>

<p>"I'm going over to Lewston's. Perhaps he
knows of a boat," said Harry; and away he ran.</p>

<p>But Lewston was not in his cabin, and so
Harry hurried along a road in the woods that
led by another negro cabin about a half-mile
away, thinking that the old man had gone off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
in that direction. Every minute or two he
shouted at the top of his voice, "Oh, Lewston!"</p>

<p>Very soon he heard some one shouting in
reply, and he recognized Lewston's voice. It
seemed to come from the creek.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Harry made his way through the
trees and soon caught sight of the old colored
man. He was in a boat, poling his way along in
the shallow water as close to dry land as the
woods allowed him, and sometimes, where the
trees were wide apart, sending the boat right
between some of their tall trunks.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lewston," cried Harry, running as
near as he could go without getting his shoes
wet, for the water ran up quite a distance
among the trees in some places. "What are
you about? Where did you get that boat? I
want a boat."</p>

<p>"Dat's jist what I thought, Mah'sr Harry,"
said Lewston, still poling away as hard as he
could. "I know de compuny'd want to git
ober de creek, an' I jist went up to Hiram Anderson's
and borrowed his ole boat. Ise been
a-bailing her out all de mornin'."</p>

<p>"You're a trump, Lewston," said Harry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
"Pole her down opposite your house, and then
one of us will go over. Why don't you go out
farther? You can't get along half as fast in here
by the trees and hummocks as you could in
deeper water."</p>

<p>"You don't ketch me out dar in dat runnin'
water," said Lewston. "I'd be in the middle
afore I knowed it, and dis pole's pooty short."</p>

<p>"Well, come along as fast as you can," cried
Harry, "and I'll run down to your house and
get your axe to cut a longer pole."</p>

<p>By the time Harry had found a tall young
sapling, and had cut it down and trimmed it off,
Lewston arrived with the boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Crossing the Creek.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>"Now, then," said Harry, "here's the boat
and a good pole, and you've nothing to
do, Harvey, but just to get in and push yourself
over to your station as fast as you can."</p>

<p>But the situation did not seem to strike Harvey
very favorably. He looked rather dissatisfied
with the arrangement made for him.</p>

<p>"I can't swim," he said. "At least, not
much, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, who wants you to swim?" said Harry,
laughing. "That's a pretty joke. Are you
thinking of swimming across, and towing the
boat after you? You can push her over easy
enough; that pole will reach the bottom anywhere."</p>

<p>"Dat's so," said old Lewston. "It'll touch
de bottom ob de water, but I don't know 'bout
de bottom ob de mud. Ye musn't push her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
down too deep. Dar's 'bout as much mud as
water out dar in de creek."</p>

<p>The more they talked about the matter, the
greater became Harvey's disinclination to go
over. He was not a coward, but he was not
used to the water or the management of a boat,
and the trip seemed much more difficult to him
than it would have appeared to a boy accustomed
to boating.</p>

<p>"I tell you what we'll do," cried Harry, at
last. "You take my station, Harvey, and I'll go
over and work your end of the line."</p>

<p>There was no opposition to this plan, and so
Harry hurried off with Harvey to Lewston's cabin
and helped him to make the connections and
get the line in working order at that end, and
then he ran down to the boat, jumped in, and
Lewston pushed him off.</p>

<p>Harry poled the boat along quite easily
through the shallow water, and when he got
farther out he found that he proceeded with
still greater ease, only he did not go straight
across, but went a little too much down stream.</p>

<p>But he pushed out strongly toward the
opposite shore, and soon reached the middle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the creek. Then he began to go down stream
very fast indeed. Push and pole as he would,
he seemed to have no control whatever over the
boat. He had had no idea that the current
would be so strong.</p>

<p>On he went, right down toward the bridge,
and as the boat swept over it, one end struck an
upright beam that projected above the water,
and the clumsy craft was jerked around with
such violence that Harry nearly tumbled into the
creek.</p>

<p>He heard Lewston and Harvey shouting to
him, but he paid no attention to them. He
was working with all his strength to get the
boat out of the current and into shallower water.
But as he found that he was not able to do that,
he made desperate efforts to stop the boat by
thrusting his pole into the bottom. It was not
easy to get the pole into the mud, the current
was so strong; but he succeeded at last, by
pushing it out in front of him, in forcing it into
the bottom; and then, in a moment, it was
jerked out of his hand, as the boat swept on,
and, a second time, he came near tumbling overboard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>Now he was helpless. No, there was the
short pole that Lewston had left in the boat.</p>

<p>He picked it up, but he could do nothing
with it. If it had been an oar, now, it might
have been of some use. He tried to pull up the
seat, but it was nailed fast.</p>

<p>On he rapidly floated, down the middle of
the stream; the boat sometimes sidewise, sometimes
with one end foremost, and sometimes the
other. Very soon he lost sight of Lewston and
Harvey, and the last he saw of them they were
hurrying by the edge of the water, in the woods.
Now he sat down, and looked about him. The
creek appeared to be getting wider and wider,
and he thought that if he went on at that rate
he must soon come to the river. The country
seemed unfamiliar to him. He had never seen
it, from the water, when it was overflowed in this
way.</p>

<p>He passed a wide stretch of cultivated fields,
mostly planted in tobacco, but he could not
recollect what farmer had tobacco down by the
creek this year. There were some men at work
on a piece of rising ground, but they were a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
way off. Still, Harry shouted to them, but they
did not appear to hear him.</p>

<p>Then he passed on among the trees again,
bumping against stumps, turning and twisting,
but always keeping out in the middle of the
current. He began to be very uneasy, especially
as he now saw, what he had not noticed before,
that the boat was leaking badly.</p>

<p>He made up his mind that he must do something
soon, even if he had to take off his clothes
and jump in and try to swim to shore. But this,
he was well aware, would be hard work in such a
current.</p>

<p>Looking hurriedly around, he saw, a short
distance before him, a tree that appeared to
stand almost in the middle of the creek, with its
lower branches not very high above the water.
The main current swirled around this tree, and
the boat was floating directly toward it.</p>

<p>Harry's mind was made up in an instant.
He stood up on the seat, and as the boat passed
under the tree he seized the lowest branch.</p>

<p>In a moment the boat was jerked from under
his feet, and he hung suspended over the rushing
water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>He gripped the branch with all his strength,
and giving his legs a swing, got his feet over it.
Then, after two or three attempts, he managed
to draw himself up and get first one leg and then
his whole body over the branch. Then he sat
up and shuffled along to the trunk, against which
he leaned with one arm around it, all in a perspiration,
and trembling with the exertion and
excitement.</p>

<p>When he had rested awhile, he stood up on
the limb and looked toward the land. There, to
his joy, he saw, at a little distance, a small log-house,
and there was some one living in it, for
he saw smoke coming from the log and mud
chimney that was built up against one end of
the cabin.</p>

<p>Harry gave a great shout, and then another,
and another, and presently a negro woman came
out of the cabin and looked out over the creek.
Then three colored children came tumbling out,
and they looked out over the creek.</p>

<p>Then Harry shouted again, and the woman
saw him.</p>

<p>"Hello, dar!" she cried. "Who's dat?"</p>

<p>"It's me! Harry Loudon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harry Loudon?" shouted the woman,
running down to the edge of the water. "Mah'sr
John Loudon's son Harry? What you doin'
dar? Is you fishin'?"</p>

<p>"Fishing!" cried Harry. "No! I want to
get ashore. Have you a boat?"</p>

<p>"A boat! Lors a massy! I got no boat,
Mah'sr Harry. How did ye git dar?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I got adrift, and my boat's gone! Isn't
there any man about?"</p>

<p>"No man about here," said the woman.
"My ole man's gone off to de railroad. But
he'll be back dis evenin'."</p>

<p>"I can't wait here till he comes," cried
Harry. "Haven't you a rope and some boards
to make a raft?"</p>

<p>"Lor', no! Mah'sr Harry. I got no boards."</p>

<p>"Tell ye what ye do, dar," shouted the biggest
boy, a woolly-heady urchin, with nothing
on but a big pair of trousers that came up under
his arms and were fastened over his shoulders
by two bits of string, "jist you come on dis
side and jump down, an' slosh ashore."</p>

<p>"It's too deep," cried Harry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, 'tain't," said the boy. "I sloshed out
to dat tree dis mornin'."</p>

<p>"You did, you Pomp!" cried his mother.
"Oh! I'll lick ye fur dat, when I git a-hold
of ye!"</p>

<p>"Did you, really?" cried Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," shouted the undaunted Pomp.
"I sloshed out dar an' back agin."</p>

<p>"But the water's higher now," said Harry.</p>

<p>"No, 'tain't," said the woman. "Tain't riz
much dis mornin'. Done all de risin' las' night.
Dat tree's jist on de edge of de creek bank. If
Pomp could git along dar, you kin, Mah'sr
Harry! Did ye go out dar, sure 'nuff, you
Pomp? Mind, if ye didn't, I'll lick ye!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," said Pomp; "clar out dar an'
back agin."</p>

<p>"Then I'll try it," cried Harry; and clambering
around the trunk of the tree, he jumped
off as far as he could toward shore.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">The First Business Telegrams.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When Harry jumped from the tree, he
came down on his feet, in water not quite
up to his waist, and then he pushed in toward
land as fast as he could go. In a few minutes,
he stood in the midst of the colored family, his
trousers and coat-tails dripping, and his shoes
feeling like a pair of wet sponges.</p>

<p>"Ye ought to have rolled up yer pants and
tooked off yer shoes and stockin's afore ye
jumped, Mah'sr Harry," said the woman.</p>

<p>"I wish I had taken off my shoes," said
Harry.</p>

<p>The woman at whose cabin Harry found
himself was Charity Allen, and a good, sensible
woman she was. She made Harry hurry into
the house, and she got him her husband's Sunday
trousers, which she had just washed and
ironed, and insisted on his putting them on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
while she dried his own. She hung his stockings
and his coat before the fire, and made one
of the boys rub his shoes with a cloth so as to
dry them as much as possible before putting
them near the fire.</p>

<p>Harry was very impatient to be off, but
Charity was so certain that he would catch his
death of cold if he started before his clothes
were dry that he allowed himself to be persuaded
to wait.</p>

<p>And then she fried some salt pork, on which,
with a great piece of corn-bread, he made a
hearty meal, for he was very hungry.</p>

<p>"Have you had your dinner, Charity?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mah'sr Harry; long time ago," she
said.</p>

<p>"Then it must be pretty late," said Harry,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said she; "'tain't late. I reckon
it can't be much mor' 'n four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Four o'clock!" shouted Harry, jumping up
in such a hurry that he nearly tripped himself
in Uncle Oscar's trousers, which were much
too long for him. "Why, that's dreadfully late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Where can the day have gone? I must be off,
instantly!"</p>

<p>So much had happened since morning, that
it was no wonder that Harry had not noticed
how the hours had flown.</p>

<p>The ride to the creek, the discussions there,
the delay in getting the boat, the passage down
the stream, which was much longer than Harry
had imagined, and the time he had spent in the
tree and in the cabin, had, indeed, occupied
the greater part of the day.</p>

<p>And even now he was not able to start.
Though he urged her as much as he could, he
could not make Charity understand that it was
absolutely necessary that he must have his
clothes, wet or dry; and he did not get them
until they were fit to put on. And then his
shoes were not dry, but, as he intended to run
all the way to Aunt Judy's cabin, that did not
matter so much.</p>

<p>"How far is it to Aunt Judy's?" he asked,
when at last he was ready to start.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckons it's 'bout six or seben miles,
Mah'sr Harry," said Charity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Six or seven miles!" exclaimed Harry.
"When shall I get there!"</p>

<p>"Now don't hurry and git yese'f all in a
heat," said Charity. "Jist keep along dis path
fru de woods till ye strike de road, and that'll
take ye straight to de bridge. Wish I had a
mule to len' ye."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Charity," cried Harry. "I'm
ever so much obliged." And hurriedly searching
his vest pockets, he found a ten-cent note and a
few pennies, which he gave to the children, who
grinned in silent delight, and then he started
off on a run.</p>

<p>But he did not run all the way.</p>

<p>Before long he began to tire a little, and
then he settled down into a fast walk. He felt
that he must hurry along as fast as he was able.
The fortunes of the Crooked Creek Telegraph
Company depended upon him. If the company
failed in this, its first opportunity, there was no
hope for it.</p>

<p>So on he walked, and before very long he
struck the main road. Here he thought he
should be able to get along faster, but there was
no particular reason for it. In fact, the open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
road was rather rougher than that through the
woods. But it was cooler here than under the
heavy, overhanging trees.</p>

<p>And now Harry first noticed that the sun
was not shining. At least, it was behind the
western hills. It must be growing very late, he
thought.</p>

<p>On he went, for a mile or two, and then it
began to grow dusky. Night was surely coming
on.</p>

<p>At a turn in the wood, he met a negro boy
with a tin bucket on his head. Harry knew
him. It was Tom Haskins.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom!" said Harry, stopping for a
moment; "I want you."</p>

<p>"What you want, Mah'sr Harry?" asked
Tom.</p>

<p>"I want you to come to Aunt Judy's cabin
and carry some messages over to Hetertown for
me."</p>

<p>"When you want me?" said Tom; "to-morrer
mornin'?"</p>

<p>"No; I want you to-night. This minute.
I'll pay you."</p>

<p>"To-night?" cried the astonished Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
"Go ober dar in de dark! Can't do dat, Mah'sr
Harry. Ise 'fraid to go fru de woods in de
dark."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," cried Harry. "Nothing's going
to hurt you. Come on over."</p>

<p>"Can't do it, Mah'sr Harry, no how," said
Tom. "Ise got ter tote dis hyar buttermilk
home; dey's a-waitin' fur it now. But p'r'aps
Jim'll go fur you. He kin borrer a mule and go
fur you, Mah'sr Harry, I 'spects."</p>

<p>"Well, tell Jim to get a mule and come to
Aunt Judy's just as quick as he can. I'll pay
him right well."</p>

<p>"Dat's so, Mah'sr Harry; Jim'll go 'long fur
ye. I'll tell him."</p>

<p>"Now be quick about it," cried Harry. "I'm
in a great hurry." And off he started again.</p>

<p>But as he hurried along, his legs began to
feel stiff and his feet were sore. He had walked
very fast, so far, but now he was obliged to
slacken his pace.</p>

<p>And it grew darker and darker. Harry
thought he had never seen night come on so
fast. It was certainly a long distance from Charity's
cabin to Aunt Judy's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he reached the well-known woods
near the bridge, and off in a little opening he
saw Aunt Judy's cabin. It was so dark now that
he would not have known it was a cabin, had he
not been so familiar with it.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there was no light to
be seen in the house. Harry hurried to the
door and found it shut. He tried to open it, and
it was locked. Had Aunt Judy gone away?
She never went away; it was foolish to suppose
such a thing.</p>

<p>He knocked upon the door, and receiving no
answer, he knocked louder, and then he kicked.
In a minute or two, during which he kept up a
continual banging and calling on the old woman,
he heard a slight movement inside. Then he
knocked and shouted, "Aunt Judy!"</p>

<p>"Who dar!" said a voice within.</p>

<p>"It's me! Harry Loudon!" cried Harry.
"Let me in!"</p>

<p>"What ye want dar?" said Aunt Judy.
"Go 'way from dar."</p>

<p>"I want to come in. Open the door."</p>

<p>"Can't come in hyar. Ise gone to bed."</p>

<p>"But I must come in," cried Harry, in desperation;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
"I've got to work the line. They're
waiting for me. Open the door, do you hear
Aunt Judy?"</p>

<p>"Go 'way wid yer line," said Aunt Judy,
crossly. "Ise abed. Come in der mornin'.
Time enough in de day-time to work lines."</p>

<p>Harry now began to get angry. He found a
stone and he banged the door. He threatened
Aunt Judy with the law. He told her she had
no right to go to bed and keep the company out
of their station, when the creek was up; but,
from her testy answers, his threats seemed to
have made but little impression upon her. She
didn't care if they stopped her pay, or fined her,
or sent her to prison. She never heard of "sich
bisness, a-wakin' people out of their beds in the
middle o' the night fur dem foolin' merchines."</p>

<p>But Harry's racket had a good effect, after
all. It woke Aunt Judy, and after a time
she got out of bed, uncovered the fire, blew up
a little blaze, lighted a candle, and putting on
some clothes, came and opened the door, grumbling
all the time.</p>

<p>"Now den," said she, holding the candle
over her head, and looking like a black Witch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Ender just out of the ground, "What you
want?"</p>

<p>"I want to come in," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Well, den, come in," said she.</p>

<p>Harry was not slow to enter, and having
made Aunt Judy bring him two candles, which
he told her the company would pay for, he set
to work to get his end of the line in working
order.</p>

<p>When all was ready, he sat down to the instrument
and "called" Harvey.</p>

<p>He felt very anxious as he did this. How
could he be sure that Harvey was there? What
a long time for that poor fellow to wait, without
having any assurance that Harry would get
across the creek at all, much less reach his post,
and go to work.</p>

<p>"He may suppose I'm drowned," thought
Harry, "and he may have gone home to tell the
folks."</p>

<p>But there was such a sterling quality about
Harvey that Harry could not help feeling that
he would find him in his place when he telegraphed
to him, no matter how great the delay
or how doubtful the passage of the creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>But when he called there was no answer.</p>

<p>Still he kept the machine steadily ticking.
He would not give up hoping that Harvey was
there, although his heart beat fast with nervous
anxiety. So far, he had not thought that his
family might be frightened about him. <i>He</i>
knew he was safe, and that had been enough.
He had not thought about other people.</p>

<p>But as these ideas were running through his
head and troubling him greatly, there came a
"tick, tick" from the other side, then more of
them, but they meant nothing. Some one was
there who could not work the instrument.</p>

<p>Then suddenly came a message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Is that you, Harry?</p></div>

<p>Joyfully, Harry answered:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Yes. Who wants to know?</p></div>

<p>The answer was:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your father. He has just waked me up.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Harvey.</span></p></div>

<p>With a light heart, Harry telegraphed, as
briefly as possible, an account of his adventures;
and then his father sent a message, telling him
that the family had heard that he had been carried
away, and had been greatly troubled about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
him, and that men had ridden down the stream
after him, and had not returned, and that he,
Mr. Loudon, had just come to Lewston's cabin,
hoping for news by telegraph. Harvey had
been there all day. Mr. Loudon said he would
now hurry home with the good news, but before
bidding his son good night, he told him that he
must not think of returning until the creek had
fallen. He must stay at Aunt Judy's, or go over
to Hetertown.</p>

<p>When this had been promised, and a message
sent to his mother and Kate, Harry hastened to
business. He telegraphed to Harvey to transmit
the company's messages as fast as he could; a
boy would soon be there to take them over to
Hetertown. The answer came:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What messages?</p></div>

<p>Then Harry suddenly remembered that he
had had the messages in the breast-pocket of his
coat all the time!</p>

<p>He dived at his pocket. Yes, there they
were!</p>

<p>Was there ever such a piece of absurdity?
He had actually carried those despatches across
the creek! After all the labor and expense of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
building the telegraph, this had been the way
that the first business messages had crossed
Crooked Creek!</p>

<p>When Harry made this discovery he burst
out laughing. Why, he might as well have carried
them to Hetertown from Charity's cabin.
It would really have been better, for the distance
was not so great.</p>

<p>Although he laughed, he felt a little humiliated.
How Tom Selden, and indeed everybody,
would laugh if they knew it!</p>

<p>But there was no need to tell everybody, and
so when he telegraphed the fact to Harvey, he
enjoined secrecy. He knew he could trust
Harvey.</p>

<p>And now he became anxious about Jim.
Would he be able to borrow a mule, and would
he come?</p>

<p>Every few minutes he went to the door and
listened for the sound of approaching hoofs, but
nothing was to be heard but the low snoring of
Aunt Judy, who was fast asleep in a chair by the
fireplace.</p>

<p>While thus waiting, a happy thought came
into Harry's head. He opened the messages&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
had a right to do that, of course, as he was
an operator and had undertaken to transmit
them&mdash;and he telegraphed them, one by one, to
Harvey, with instructions to him to send them
back to him.</p>

<p>"They shall come over the creek on our
line, anyway," said Harry to himself.</p>

<p>It did not take long to send them and to
receive them again, for there were only three of
them. Then Harvey sent a message, congratulating
Harry on this happy idea, and also suggested
that he, Harvey, should now ride home,
as it was getting late, and it was not likely that
there would be any more business that night.</p>

<p>Harry agreed to this, urging Harvey to return
early in the morning, and then he set to work
to write out the messages. The company had
not yet provided itself with regular forms, but
Harry copied the telegrams carefully on note-paper,
with which, with pen and ink, each station
was furnished, writing them, as far as possible,
in the regular form and style of the ordinary
telegraphic despatch. Then he put them in an
envelope and directed them to Mr. Lyons, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Hetertown, indorsing them, "In haste. To be
transmitted to destination immediately."</p>

<p>"Now then," thought he, "nobody need
know how these came over in the first place,
until we choose to tell them, and we won't do
that until we've sent over some messages in the
regular way, and have proved that our line is
really of some use. And we won't charge the
Mica Company anything for these despatches.
But yet, I don't know about that. I certainly
brought them over, and trouble enough I had
to do it. I'll see about charging, after I've
talked it over with somebody. I reckon I'll ask
father about that. And I haven't delayed the
messages, either; for I've been waiting for Jim.
I wonder where that boy can be!" And again
Harry went out of doors to listen.</p>

<p>Had he known that Jim was at that moment
fast asleep in his bed at home, Harry need not
have gone to the door so often.</p>

<p>At last our operator began to be very sleepy,
and having made up his mind that if Jim arrived
he would certainly wake him up, he aroused
Aunt Judy, who was now too sleepy to scold,
and having succeeded in getting her to lend him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
a blanket (it was her very best blanket, which
she kept for high days and holidays, and if she
had been thoroughly awake she would not have
lent it for the purpose), and having spread it
on the floor, he lay down on it and was soon
asleep.</p>

<p>Aunt Judy blew out one of the candles and
set the other on the hearth. Then she stumbled
drowsily into the next room and shut the
door after her. In a few minutes every living
creature in and about the place was fast asleep,
excepting some tree-frogs and katydids outside,
who seemed to have made up their minds
to stay up all night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Profits and Projects</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning, Harry was up quite
early, and after having eaten a very plain
breakfast, which Aunt Judy prepared for him,
he ran down to the creek to see what chance
there was for business.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a very good chance, for
the creek had not fallen, that was certain. If
there was any change at all, the water seemed a
little higher than it was before.</p>

<p>Before long, Harvey arrived on the other
side, accompanied by Tom Selden and Wilson
Ogden, who were very anxious to see how matters
would progress, now that there was some
real work to do.</p>

<p>The boys sent messages and greetings backward
and forward to each other for about an
hour, and then old Miles arrived with his mailbag,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
which contained quite a number of telegrams,
this time.</p>

<p>Not only were there those on the business of
the Mica Company, but Mr. Darby, the storekeeper
at Akeville, thought it necessary to send
a message to Hetertown by the new line, and
there were two or three other private telegrams,
that would probably never have been sent had it
not been for the novelty of the thing.</p>

<p>But that rascal, Jim Haskins, did not make
his appearance, and when Harry found that it
was not likely that he would come at all, he induced
Aunt Judy to go out and look for some
one to carry the telegrams to Hetertown. Harry
had just finished copying the messages&mdash;and this
took some time, for he wrote each one of them in
official form&mdash;when Aunt Judy returned, bringing
with her a telegraphic messenger.</p>

<p>It was Uncle Braddock.</p>

<p>"Here's a man to take yer letters," said Aunt
Judy, as she ushered in the old man.</p>

<p>Harry looked up from his table in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Braddock," said he, "you
can't carry these telegrams. I want a boy, on a
mule or a horse, to go as fast as he can."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lor' bress ye, Mah'sr Harry," said the old
negro, "I kin git along fas' enough. Aunt Judy
said ye wanted Jim, an' Nobleses mule; but dat
dar mule he back hindwards jist about as much
as he walks frontwards. I jist keep right straight
along, an' I kin beat dat dar ole mule, all holler.
Jist gim me yer letters, an' I'll tote 'em ober dar
fur ten cents. Ye see I wuz cotched on dis side
de creek, an' wuz jist comin ober to see Aunt
Judy, when she telled me ob dis job. I'll tote
yer letters, Mah'sr Harry, fur ten cents fur de
bag-full."</p>

<p>"I haven't a bag-full," said Harry; "but I
reckon you'll have to take them. There's nobody
else about, it seems, and I can't leave the station."</p>

<p>So Uncle Braddock was engaged as telegraph-boy,
and Harry having promised him
twenty cents to go to Hetertown and to return
with any telegrams that were there awaiting
transmission to the other side of the creek, the
old man set off with his little package, in high
good humor with the idea of earning money by
no harder work than walking a few miles.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon, he returned with a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
messages from Hetertown, and by that time
there were some for him to carry back. So he
made two trips and forty cents that day&mdash;quite
an income for Uncle Braddock.</p>

<p>In the evening, Jim Haskins made his appearance
with his mule. He said his brother
hadn't told him anything about Harry's wanting
him until that afternoon. Notwithstanding
Uncle Braddock's discouraging account of the
mule, Jim was engaged as messenger during the
time that the creek should be up, and Uncle
Braddock was promised a job whenever an important
message should come during Jim's
absence.</p>

<p>The next day it rained, and the creek was
up, altogether, for five days. During this time
the telegraph company did a good deal of paying
business. Harry remained at his station,
and boarded and lodged with Aunt Judy. He
frequently sent messages to his father and
mother and Kate, and never failed, from an
early hour in the morning until dark, to find the
faithful Harvey at his post.</p>

<p>At last the creek "fell," and the bridge
became again passable to Miles and his waddling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
horse. The operators disconnected their wires,
put their apparatus in order, locked the wooden
cases over their instruments, and rode in triumph
(Mr. Loudon had come in the buggy for Harry)
to Akeville.</p>

<p>Harry was received with open arms by his
mother and Kate; and Mrs. Loudon declared
that this should be the last time that he should
go on such an expedition.</p>

<p>She was right.</p>

<p>The next afternoon there was a meeting of
the Board of Managers of the Crooked Creek
Telegraph Company, and the Secretary, having
been hard at work all the morning, with the
assistance of the Treasurer and the President,
made a report of the financial results of the
recent five days' working of the company's
line.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into particulars, but
when the sums due the company from the Mica
Company and sundry private individuals had
been set down on the one side, and the amounts
due from the telegraph company to Aunt Judy
for candles and board and lodging for one operator;
to Uncle Braddock and Jim Haskins for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
services as messengers; to Hiram Anderson for
damages to boat (found near the river, stuck fast
among some fallen timber, with one end badly
battered by floating logs), and for certain extras
in the way of additional stationery, etc., which
it had become necessary to procure from Hetertown,
had been set down on the other side, and
the difference between the sums total had been
calculated, it was found, and duly reported, that
the company had made six dollars and fifty-three
cents.</p>

<p>This was not very encouraging. It was seldom
that the creek was up more than five days
at a time, and so this was a very favorable opportunity
of testing the value of the line as a
money-making concern.</p>

<p>It was urged, however, by the more sanguine
members of the Board that this was not a fair
trial. There had been many expenses which
probably would not have to be incurred again.</p>

<p>"But they didn't amount to so very much,"
said Kate, who, as Treasurer, was present at the
meeting. "Aunt Judy only charged a dollar
and a half for Harry's board, and the boat was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
only a dollar. And all the other expenses would
have to be expected any time."</p>

<p>After some further conversation on the subject,
it was thought best to attend to present
business rather than future prospects, and to
appoint committees to collect the money due
the company.</p>

<p>Harry and Tom Selden were delegated to
visit the mica-mine people, while Harvey, Wilson
Ogden, and Brandeth Price composed the committee
to collect what was due from private
individuals.</p>

<p>Before Harry started for the mica mine, he
consulted his father in regard to charging full
price for the telegrams which he carried across
the creek in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon laughed a good deal at the
transaction, but he told Harry that there was no
reason why he should not charge for those telegrams.
He had certainly carried them over in
the first place, and the subsequent double transmission
over the wire was his own affair.</p>

<p>When Harry and Tom rode over to the mica
mine the next morning, and explained their business
and presented their bill, their account was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
found to be correct, and the amount of the bill
was promptly handed to them.</p>

<p>When this little business had been transacted,
Mr. Martin, the manager of the mine, invited
them to sit down in his office and have a talk.</p>

<p>"This line of yours," said he, "is not going
to pay you."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Harry, somewhat disturbed
in mind by this sudden statement of
what he had already begun to fear was an unpleasant
truth.</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> paid us," said Tom Selden. "Why,
we've only been working it five days, on regular
business, and we've cleared&mdash;well, we've cleared
considerable."</p>

<p>"That may be," said the manager, smiling,
"but you can't have made very much, for you
must have a good many expenses. The principal
reason why I think it won't pay you is that
you have to keep up two stations, and you all
live on this side of the creek. I've heard that
one of you had a hard time getting over the
creek last week."</p>

<p>"That was Harry," said Tom.</p>

<p>"So I supposed," said Mr. Martin; "and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
must have been a pretty dangerous trip. Now
it won't do to do that sort of thing often; and
you can't tell when the creek's going to rise, so
as to be over before the bridge is flooded."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Harry. "Crooked Creek
doesn't give much notice when it's going to
rise."</p>

<p>"No, it don't," continued Mr. Martin. "And
it won't do, either, for any one of you to live on
the other side, just to be ready to work the line
in time of freshets. The creek isn't up often
enough to make that pay."</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" asked Harry. "You
surely don't think we're going to give up this
telegraph line just as it begins to work, and after
all the money that's been spent on it, and the
trouble we've had?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you are the kind of fellows
to give up a thing so soon, and we don't
want you to give it up, for it's been a great deal
of use to us already. What I think you ought
to do is to run your line from the other side of
the creek to Hetertown. Then you'd have no
trouble at all. When the creek was up you
could go down and work this end, and an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
arrangement could easily be made to have the
operator at Hetertown work the other end, and
then it would be all plain sailing. He could send
the telegrams right on, on the regular line, and
there would be no trouble or expense with messengers
from the creek over to Hetertown."</p>

<p>"That would be a splendid plan," said Harry;
"but it would cost like everything to have a long
line like that."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't cost very much," said Mr. Martin.
"There are pine woods nearly all the way,
by the side of the road, and so it wouldn't cost
much for poles. And you've got the instruments
for that end of the line. All you'll have
to do would be to take them over to Hetertown.
You wouldn't have to spend any money except
for wire and for trimming off the trees and putting
up the wire."</p>

<p>"But that would be more than we could
afford," said Tom Selden. "You ought just to
try to make the people about here subscribe to
anything, and you'd see what trouble it is to raise
money out of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think you need let the want of
money enough to buy a few miles of wire prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
your putting up a really useful line," said
Mr. Martin; "our company would be willing to
help you about that, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"If you'd help, that would make it altogether
another thing," said Harry; "but you'd have
to help a good deal."</p>

<p>"Well, we would help a good deal," said
Mr. Martin. "It would be to our benefit, you
know, to have a good line. That's what we
want, and we're willing to put some money in it.
I suppose there'd be no difficulty in getting permission
to put up the line on the land between
the creek and Hetertown?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Harry. "A good part of the
woods along the road belong to father, and none
of the people along there would object to us
boys putting up our line on their land."</p>

<p>"I thought they wouldn't," said Mr. Martin.
"I'll talk to our people about this, and see what
they think of it."</p>

<p>As Harry and Tom rode home, Harry
remarked, "Mr. Martin's a trump, isn't he? I
hope the rest of the mica-mine people will
agree with him."</p>

<p>"I don't believe they will," said Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
"Why, you see they'd have to pay for the whole
thing, and I reckon they won't be in a hurry to
do that. But wouldn't we have a splendid line
if they were to do it?"</p>

<p>"I should say so," said Harry. "It's almost
too good a thing to expect. I'm afraid Mr.
Martin won't feel quite so generous when he
calculates what it will cost."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Grand Proposition.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The summer vacation was now over, and
the Board of Managers of the telegraph
company, as well as the other boys of the vicinity,
were obliged to go to school again and
study something besides the arts of making
money and transacting telegraphic business.
But as there was not much business of this kind
to be done, the school interfered with the company's
affairs in little else than the collection
of money due from private individuals for telegraphic
services rendered during the late "rise"
in the creek. The committee which had charge
of this collection labored very faithfully for
some time, and before and after school and
during the noon recess, the members thereof
made frequent visits to the houses of the company's
debtors. As there were not more than
half-a-dozen debtors, it might have been supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
that the business would be speedily performed.
But such was not the case. Mr.
Darby, the storekeeper, paid his bill promptly;
and old Mr. Truly Matthews, who had telegraphed
to Washington to a nephew in the
Patent Office Department, "just to see how it
would go," paid what he owed on the eighth
visit of Wilson Ogden to his house. He had
not seen "how it would go," for his nephew had
not answered him, either by telegraph or mail,
and he was in no hurry to pay up, but he could
not stand "that boy opening his gate three
times a day." As for the rest, they promised to
settle as soon as they could get some spare cash&mdash;which
happy time they expected would arrive
when they sold their tobacco.</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that no one ever bought
their tobacco, for they never paid up.</p>

<p>The proceeds of the five days of telegraphing,
together with the money obtained by the
sale of Harry's gun, were spent by Kate for
Aunt Matilda's benefit; and as she knew that it
might be a good while before there would be
any more money coming, Kate was as economical
as she could be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all very proper and kind to make the
old woman's income hold out as long as possible,
but Aunt Matilda did not like this systematic
and economical way of living. It was too
late in life for her, she said, "to do more measurin'
at a meal than chewin';" and so she
became discouraged, and managed, one fine
morning, to hobble up to see Mrs. Loudon
about it.</p>

<p>"Ise afraid dese chillen ain't a-gwine to hold
out," said she. "I don know but what I'd better
go 'long to the poor-house, arter all. And
there's that money I put inter de comp'ny. I
ain't seen nothin' come o' dat ar money yit."</p>

<p>"How much did you put in, Aunt Matilda?"
asked Mrs. Loudon.</p>

<p>"Well, I needn't be a-sayin' jist how much
it was; but it was solid silver, anyway, and I
don't reckon I'll ever see any of it back again.
But it don't differ much. Ise an old woman,
and them chillen is a-doin' their best."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are," said Mrs. Loudon; "and I
think they're doing very well, too. You haven't
suffered for anything lately, have you?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said the old woman, "I can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
say that I've gone hungry or nuthin'; but I was
only a-gittin' 'fraid I might. Dis hyar 'tic'lar
way o' doin' things makes a person scary."</p>

<p>"I am glad that Kate is particular," said
Mrs. Loudon. "You know, Aunt Matilda, that
money isn't very plenty with any of us, and we
all have to learn to make it go as far as it will.
I don't think you need feel 'scary,' if Kate's
economy is all you have to fear."</p>

<p>This interview somewhat reassured Aunt
Matilda, but she was not altogether satisfied
with the state of things. The fact was that she
had supposed that the telegraph company would
bring in so much money that she would be able
to live in what to her would be a state of comparative
luxury. And instead of that, Kate had
been preaching economy and systematic management
to her. No wonder she was disappointed,
and a little out of humor with her young
guardians.</p>

<p>But for all that, if Harry or Kate had fallen
into a fiery crater, Aunt Matilda would have
hurried in after them as fast as her old legs
would have carried her.</p>

<p>She went back to her cabin, after a while, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
she continued to have her three meals a day all
the same as usual; but if she could have seen,
as Kate saw, how steadily the little fund for her
support was diminishing day by day, she would
have had some reason for her apprehensions.</p>

<p>It was on a pleasant Saturday in early September,
that Harry stood looking over the front
gate in his father's yard. Kate was at the dining-room
window, sewing. Harry was thinking,
and Kate was wondering what he was thinking
about. She thought she knew, and she called
out to him: "I expect old Mr. Matthews would
lend you a gun, Harry."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose he would," said Harry,
turning and slowly walking up toward the
house; "but father told me not to borrow a gun
from Truly Matthews. It's a shame, though, to
stay here when the fields are just chock full of
partridges. I never knew them so plenty in all
my life. It's just the way things go."</p>

<p>"It is a pity about your gun," said Kate.
"There's some one at the gate, Harry. Hadn't
you better go and see what he wants? Father
won't be home until after dinner, you can tell
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry turned.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Martin," said he, and he went
down to the gate to meet him.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. President?" said Mr.
Martin. "I rode over here this morning, and
thought I would come and see you."</p>

<p>Harry shook hands with his visitor, and
invited him to walk into the house; but after
Mr. Martin had dismounted and fastened his
horse, he thought that the seat under the catalpa-tree
looked so cool and inviting, that he proposed
that they should sit down there and have
a little chat.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about the extension
of your telegraph line," said the manager of the
mica mine, "and have talked it over with our
people. They agree with me that it would be a
good thing, and we have determined, if it suits
you and your company, that we will advance the
money necessary to carry out the scheme."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that," said Harry; "but,
as I said before, you'll have to bear the whole
expense, and it will cost a good deal to carry
the line from the creek all the way to Hetertown."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it will cost some money," said Mr.
Martin "but our idea is that you ought to
have a complete line while you are about it, and
that it ought to run from our mine to Hetertown."</p>

<p>"From your mine to Hetertown!" exclaimed
Harry, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Martin, smiling. "That is
the kind of a line that is really needed. You
see, our business is increasing, and we are buying
land which we intend to sell out in small
farms, and so expect to build up quite a little
village out there in time. So you can understand
that we would like to be in direct communication
with Richmond and the North.
And if we can have it by means of your line, we
are ready to put the necessary funds into the
work."</p>

<p>Harry was so amazed at this statement, that
he could hardly find words with which to express
himself.</p>

<p>"Why, that would give us a regular, first-class
telegraph line!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Martin, "and that's the
only kind of a line that is really worth anything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what to think about it," said
Harry. "I didn't expect you to propose anything
like this."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Martin, rising, "I must be
off. I had only a few minutes to spare, but I
thought I had better come and make you this
proposition. I think you had better lay it before
your Board of Managers as soon as possible, and
if you will take my advice, as a business man,
you'll accept our offer."</p>

<p>So saying, he bid Harry good-by, took off his
hat to Kate, who was still looking out of the
window, mounted his horse, and rode away.</p>

<p>There was a meeting of the Board of Managers
of the Crooked Creek Telegraph Company
that afternoon. It was a full meeting, for Harry
sent hasty messengers to those he called the
"out-lying members."</p>

<p>A more astonished body of officials has seldom
been seen than was our Board when Harry
laid the proposition of Mr. Martin before it.</p>

<p>But the boys were not so much amazed that
they could not jump at this wonderful opportunity
and in a very short time it was unanimously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
voted to accept the proposition of the mica-mine
people, and to build the great line.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as this important vote had
been taken, the meeting adjourned, and the
members hurried to their several homes to carry
the news.</p>

<p>"We'll have to change our name," said Tom
Selden to Harry. "We ought to call our company
'The United States Mica and Hetertown
Lightning Express Line,' or something big like
that."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Harry. "The A 1 double-action,
back-spring, copper-fastened, broad-gauge
telegraph line from here to the moon!"</p>

<p>And away he ran to meet Kate, who was
coming down the road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">How Something Came to an End.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The mica-mine management appeared to
be thoroughly in earnest about this extension
of the telegraph line. As soon as the
assent of the Board of Managers to the scheme
had been communicated to them, they sent a
note to Harry suggesting that he should, in the
name of his company, get the written consent of
owners of the lands over which the line would
pass to the construction of said line on their
property. This business was soon settled, for
none of the owners of the farms between the
mines and Hetertown, all of whom were well
acquainted with Mr. Loudon (and no man in
that part of the country was held in higher estimation
by his neighbors), had the slightest objection
to the boys putting up their telegraph
line on their lands.</p>

<p>When Harry had secured the necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
promises, the construction of the line was commenced
forthwith. The boys had very little
trouble with it. Mr. Martin got together a
gang of men, with an experienced man to direct
them, and came down with them to Akeville,
where Harry hired them; and finding that the
foreman understood the business, he told him to
go to work and put up the line. When paydays
came around, Harry gave each man an
order for his money on the Mica Mine Company,
and their wages were paid them by Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>It was not very long before the line was constructed
and the instruments were in working
order in Hetertown and at the mica mines.
There was a person at the latter place who
understood telegraphy, and he attended to the
business at that end of the line, while Mr.
Lyons worked the instruments at the Hetertown
station, which was in the same building with
the regular telegraph line.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the Mica Company
should keep an account of all messages sent by
them over the line, and should credit the
Crooked Creek Telegraph Company with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
amount due in payment, after deducting necessary
expenses, hire of operators', and six per cent.
on the capital advanced.</p>

<p>Everything having been arranged on this
basis, the extended line went into operation,
without regard to the amount of water in the
creek, and old Miles carried no more telegrams
to Hetertown.</p>

<p>The telegraph business, however, became
much less interesting to Kate and the boys. It
seemed to them as if it had been taken entirely
out of their hands, which was, indeed, the true
state of the case. They were the nominal
owners and directors of the line, but they had
nothing to direct, and very vague ideas about
the value of the property they owned.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Tom Selden, as he sat
one afternoon in Mr. Loudon's yard, with Harry
and Kate, "whether we've made much by this
business or not. Those mica people keep all
the accounts and do all the charging, and if
they want to cheat us, I don't see what's to
hinder them."</p>

<p>"But you know," said Harry, "that we can
examine their accounts; and, besides, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Lyons will keep a tally of all the messages
sent, and I don't believe that he would cheat
us."</p>

<p>"No; I don't suppose he would," said Tom;
"but I liked the old way best. There was
more fun in it."</p>

<p>"Yes, there was," said Kate; "and then we
helped old Lewston and Aunt Judy. I expect
they'll miss the money they got for rent."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Harry. "They'll have to
deny themselves many a luxury in consequence
of the loss of that dollar a month."</p>

<p>"Now you're making fun," said Kate; "but
twelve dollars a year is a good deal to those poor
people."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is," said Harry. "In fifty
years, it would be six hundred dollars, if they
saved it all up, and that is a good deal of money,
even to us rich folks."</p>

<p>"Rich!" said Kate. "We're so dreadfully
rich that I have only forty-two cents left of Aunt
Matilda's money, and I must have some very
soon."</p>

<p>The consequence of this conversation was
that Harry had to ride over to the mica mines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and get a small advance on the payment due at
the end of the month.</p>

<p>The end of the month arrived, and the settlement
was made. When the interest on the
money advanced to put up the line, hire of operators,
and other expenses, had been deducted
from the amount due the Crooked Creek Company,
there was only two dollars and a quarter
to be paid to it!</p>

<p>Harry was astounded. He took the money,
rode back to Akeville, and hastened to have a
consultation with Kate. For the first time since
he became a guardian, he was in despair. This
money was not enough for Aunt Matilda's needs,
and if it had been, there were stockholders who
were expecting great things from the recent extension
of the line. What was to be said to
them?</p>

<p>Harry did not know, and Kate could suggest
nothing. It appeared to be quite plain that
they had made a very bad business of this telegraphic
affair. A meeting of the Board was
called, and when each member had had his say,
matters appeared worse than ever.</p>

<p>It was a very blue time for our friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Kate, she cried a good deal that afternoon.</p>

<p>The time had at last come when she felt they
would have to give up Aunt Matilda. She was
sure, if they had never started this telegraphic
company, they might have struggled through the
winter, but now there were stockholders and
creditors and she did not know what all. She
only knew that it was too much for them.</p>

<p>Three days after this, Harry received a note
from Mr. Martin. When he read it, he gave a
shout that brought everybody out of the house&mdash;Kate
first. When she read the note, which she
took from Harry as he was waving it around his
head, she stood bewildered. She could not
comprehend it.</p>

<p>And yet it simply contained a proposition
from the Mica Mine Company to buy the
Crooked Creek Telegraph Line, with all its rights
and privileges, assuming all debts and liabilities,
and to pay therefor the sum of three hundred
and fifty dollars in cash!</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Two days afterward, the line was formally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
sold to the Mica Company, and the Crooked
Creek Telegraph Company came to an end.</p>

<p>When accounts were settled, Aunt Matilda's
share of the proceeds of the sale were found to
amount to two hundred and sixty-two dollars
and fifty cents, which Kate deposited with Mr.
Darby for safe keeping.</p>

<p>It was only the sky that now looked blue to
Harry and Kate.</p>

<p>The Akeville people were a good deal surprised
at this apparently singular transaction on
the part of the Mica Company, but before long,
their reasons for helping the boys to put up their
line and then buying it, became plain enough.</p>

<p>The Mica Company had invested a large capital
in mines and lands, and the business required
telegraphic communication with the North.
The managers knew that they might have a
good deal of trouble to get permission to put
up their line on the lands between the mines
and Hetertown, and so they wisely helped the
boys to put up the line, and then bought it of
them, with all their rights and privileges.</p>

<p>There was probably some sharp practice in
this transaction, but our young friends and Aunt
Matilda profited by it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Meeting.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>About a week after the dissolution of the
Crooked Creek Company, Harry was riding
over from Hetertown, and had nearly reached
the creek on his way home, when he met George
Purvis.</p>

<p>This was their first meeting since their fight,
for George had been away on a visit to some
relatives in Richmond.</p>

<p>When Harry saw George riding slowly toward
him, he felt very much embarrassed, and
very much annoyed because he was embarrassed.</p>

<p>How should he meet George? What should
he say; or should he say anything?</p>

<p>He did not want to appear anxious to "make
up" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he
bore malice toward him. If he only knew how
George felt about it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was, he wished he had stopped somewhere
on the road. He had thought of stopping
at the mill&mdash;why had he not? That would just
have given George time to pass.</p>

<p>Both boys appeared to be riding as slowly as
their horses would consent to go, and yet when
they met, Harry had not half made up his mind
what he would say, or how he should say it, or
whether it would be better or not to say anything.</p>

<p>"Hello, George!" said he, quite unpremeditatedly.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said George, reining in his horse
"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Going home," said Harry, also stopping in
the road.</p>

<p>Thus the quarrel came to an end.</p>

<p>"So you've sold the telegraph?" said George.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harry. "And I think we made
a pretty good bargain. I didn't think we'd do
so well when we started."</p>

<p>"No, it didn't look like it," said George;
"but those mica men mayn't find it such a good
bargain for them."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Harry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, suppose some of the people who own
the land that the line's on, don't want these
strangers to have a telegraph on their farms.
What's to hinder them ordering them off?"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't do that," said Harry. "None
of the people about here would be so mean.
They'd know that it might upset our bargain.
There isn't a man who would do it."</p>

<p>"All right," said George. "I hope they
won't. But how are you going to keep the old
woman now?"</p>

<p>"How?" said Harry. "Why, we can keep
her easy enough. We got three hundred and
fifty dollars from the Mica Company."</p>

<p>"And how much is her share?"</p>

<p>"Over two hundred and sixty," answered
Harry.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said George. "That won't
give her much income. The interest on it will
only be about fifteen dollars a year, and she
can't live on that."</p>

<p>"But we didn't think of using only the interest,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"So you're going to break in on the principal,
are you? That's a poor way of doing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we'll get along well enough," said Harry.
"Two hundred and sixty dollars is a good deal
of money. Good-by! I must get on. Come up,
Selim!"</p>

<p>"Good-by!" said George; and he spurred
up his horse and rode off gayly.</p>

<p>But not so Harry. He was quite depressed
in spirits by George's remarks. He wished he
had not met him, and he determined that he
would not bother his head by looking at the
matter as George did. It was ridiculous.</p>

<p>But the more he thought of it, the more
sorry he felt that he had met George Purvis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Once more in the Woods.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>"Harry," said Kate, the next day after
this meeting, "when are you going to
get your gun back?"</p>

<p>"Get my gun back!" exclaimed Harry.
"How am I to do that?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's money enough," answered
Kate. "You only lent your gun-money to Aunt
Matilda's fund. Take out enough, and get your
gun back."</p>

<p>"That sounds very well," said Harry; "but
we haven't so much money, after all. The interest
on what we have won't begin to support
Aunt Matilda, and we really ought not to break
in on the principal."</p>

<p>Kate did not immediately answer. She
thought for a while and then she said:</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I call talking nonsense.
You must have heard some one say something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
like that. You never got it out of your own
head."</p>

<p>"It may not have come out of my own
head," said Harry, who had not told Kate of his
meeting with George Purvis, "but it is true, for
all that. It seems to me that whatever we do
seems all right at first, and then fizzles out.
This telegraph business has done that, straight
along."</p>

<p>"No, it hasn't," said Kate, with some warmth.
"It's turned out first-rate. I think that interest
idea is all stuff. As if we wanted to set up Aunt
Matilda with an income that would last forever!
Here comes father. I'm going to ask him about
the gun."</p>

<p>When Mr. Loudon had had the matter laid
before him, he expressed his opinion without
any hesitation.</p>

<p>"I think, Harry," said he, "that you certainly
ought to go and get your gun."</p>

<p>And Harry went and got it.</p>

<p>The rest of that day, which was Saturday,
was delightful, both to Harry and Kate. Harry
cleaned and polished up his gun, and Kate sat
and watched him. It seemed like old times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
During those telegraphic days, when they were
all thinking of business and making money, they
seemed to have grown old.</p>

<p>But all that was over now, and they were a
girl and a boy again. Late in the afternoon,
Harry went out and shot half-a-dozen partridges,
which were cooked for supper, and Mrs. Loudon
said that that seemed like the good old style of
things. She had feared that they were never
going to have any more game on their table.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday there was a
half-holiday, and Harry was about to start off
with his gun, when he proposed that Kate should
go with him.</p>

<p>"But you're going after birds," said Kate,
"and I can't go where you'll want to go&mdash;among
the stubble and bushes."</p>

<p>"Oh! I sha'n't go much after birds," said
Harry. "I wanted to borrow Captain Caseby's
dog, but he's going to use him himself to-day,
and so I don't expect to get much game. But
we can have a good walk in the woods."</p>

<p>"All right," said Kate. "I'll go along."
And away she went for her hat.</p>

<p>The walk was charming. It was now September,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and the fields were full of bright-colored
fall flowers, while here and there a sweet-gum
tree began to put on autumn tints. The sun
was bright, and there was a strong breeze full
of piney odors from the forests to the west.</p>

<p>They saw no game; and when they had
rambled about for an hour or so, they sat down
under an oak-tree on the edge of the woods,
and while they were talking, an idea came into
Harry's head. He picked a great big fat toadstool
that was growing near the roots of the
tree, and carrying it about sixty feet from the
tree, he stuck it up on a bush.</p>

<p>"Now then," said he, taking up his gun,
cocking it, and handing it to Kate, "you take a
shot at that mark."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I shall shoot at it?"
exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Harry. "You ought to
know how to shoot. And it won't be the first
time you have fired a gun. Take a shot."</p>

<p>"All right," said Kate. And she took off
her hat and threw it on the grass. Then she
took the gun and raised it to a level with her
eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be easy now," said Harry. "Hold the
butt close against your shoulder. Take your
time, and aim right at the middle of the mark."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm shutting the wrong eye,"
said Kate. "I always do."</p>

<p>"Shut your left eye," said Harry. "Get the
sight right between your other eye and the
mark."</p>

<p>Kate took a good long aim, and then, summoning
all her courage, she pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The gun went off with a tremendous bang!
The toadstool trembled for an instant, and then
tumbled off the bush.</p>

<p>"Hurra!" shouted Harry. "You've hit it
fair!" And he ran and brought it to her, riddled
with shot-holes. Kate was delighted with
her success, and would have been glad to have
spent the rest of the afternoon firing at a mark.
But Harry was not well enough supplied with
powder and shot for that. However, he gave
her another shot at a piece of paper on the bush.
She made three shot-holes in it, and Harry said
that would do very well. He then loaded up
again, and then they started off for home. The
path they took led through a corner of the woods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>They had not gone far before they met
Gregory Montague.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mah'sr Harry!" said Gregory, "I done
foun' a bees' nes'."</p>

<p>"Where?" cried Harry.</p>

<p>"Down in a big tree in de holler, dar," pointing
over toward the thickest part of the woods.
"You have to go fru de brush and bushes, but
it's a powerful big nest, Mah'sr Harry, right in
de holler ob de tree."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it's a bees' nest?" said Harry.
"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I knows it's a bees' nest," said Gregory,
somewhat reproachfully. "Didn't I see de bees
goin' in an' out fru a little hole?"</p>

<p>"Kate," said Harry, "you hold this gun a
little while. I'll run down there and see if it
is really a bee-tree that he has found. Hold it
under your arm, that way, with the muzzle
down. That's it. I'll be back directly." And
away he ran with Gregory.</p>

<p>And now Kate was left alone in the woods
with a gun under her arm. It was a new experience
for her. She felt proud and pleased to have
control of a gun, and it was not long before she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
began to think that it would be a splendid thing
if she could shoot something that would do for
supper. How surprised they would all be if she
should bring home some game that she had shot,
all by herself!</p>

<p>She made up her mind that she would do it,
if she could see anything to shoot.</p>

<p>And so she walked quietly along the path
with her thumb on the hammer of the gun, all
ready to cock it the instant she should see a
good chance for a shot.</p>


<hr class="major" />
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;'>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Girl and a Gun.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>A short distance beyond the place where
Kate had been left, there was a small by-path;
and when, still carefully carrying her gun,
she reached this path, Kate stopped. Here
would be a good place, she thought, to wait for
game. Something would surely come into that
little path, if she kept herself concealed.</p>

<p>So she knelt down behind a small bush that
grew at a corner of the two paths, and putting
her gun through the bush, rested the barrel in
a crotch.</p>

<p>The gun now pointed up the by-path, and
there was an opening in the bush through which
Kate could see for some distance.</p>

<p>Here, then, she watched and waited.</p>

<p>The first thing that crossed the path was a
very little bird. It hopped down from a twig, it
jerked its head about, it pecked at something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
on the ground, and then flew up into a tree.
Kate would not have shot it on any account, for
she knew it was not good to eat; but she could
not help wondering how people ever did shoot
birds, if they did not "hold still" any longer
than that little creature did.</p>

<p>Then there appeared a small brown lizard.
It came very rapidly right down the path toward
Kate.</p>

<p>"If it comes all the way," thought Kate, "I
shall have to jump."</p>

<p>But it did not come all the way, and Kate
remained quiet.</p>

<p>For some time no living creatures, except
butterflies and other insects, showed themselves.
Then, all of a sudden, there popped into the
middle of the path, not very far from Kate, a
real, live rabbit!</p>

<p>It was quite a good-sized rabbit, and Kate
trembled from head to foot. Here was a chance
indeed!</p>

<p>To carry home a fat rabbit would be a triumph.
She aimed the gun as straight toward
the rabbit as she could, having shut the wrong
eye several times before she got the matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
arranged to her satisfaction. Then she remembered
that she had not cocked the gun, and so
she had to do that, which, of course, made it
necessary for her to aim all over again.</p>

<p>She cocked only one hammer, and she did it
so gently that it did not frighten the rabbit,
although he flirted his ears a little when he
heard the "click, click!" Everything was so
quiet that he probably thought he heard some
insect, probably a young or ignorant cricket that
did not know how to chirp properly.</p>

<p>So he sat very still and nibbled at some leaves
that were growing by the side of the path. He
looked very pretty as he sat there, taking his
dainty little bites, and jerking up his head every
now and then, as if he were expecting somebody.</p>

<p>"I must wait till he's done eating," thought
Kate. "It would be cruel to shoot him now."</p>

<p>Then he stopped nibbling all of a sudden, as
if he had just thought of something, and as soon
as he remembered what it was, he twisted his
head around and began to scratch one of his
long ears with his hind foot. He looked so
funny doing this that Kate came near laughing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
but, fortunately, she remembered that that would
not do just then.</p>

<p>When he had finished scratching one ear, he
seemed to consider the question whether or not
he should scratch the other one; but he finally
came to the conclusion that he would not. He
would rather hop over to the other side of the
path and see what was there.</p>

<p>This, of course, made it necessary for Kate to
take a new aim at him.</p>

<p>Whatever it was that he found on the other
side of the path it grew under the ground, and
he stuck his head down as far as he could get
it, and bent up his back, as if he were about
to try to turn a somersault, or to stand on his
head.</p>

<p>"How round and soft he is!" thought Kate.
"How I should like to pat him. I wonder when
he'll find whatever it is that he's looking for!
What a cunning little tail!"</p>

<p>The cunning little tail was soon clapped flat
on the ground, and Mr. Bunny raised himself up
and sat on it. He lifted his nose and his fore-paws
in the air and seemed to be smelling something
good. His queer little nose wiggled so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
comically that Kate again came very near bursting
out laughing.</p>

<p>"How I would love to have him for a pet!"
she said to herself.</p>

<p>After sniffing a short time, the rabbit seemed
to come to the conclusion that he was mistaken,
after all, and that he did not really smell anything
so very good. He seemed disappointed, however,
for he lifted up one of his little fore-paws
and rubbed it across his eyes. But, perhaps, he
was not so very sorry, but only felt like taking a
nap, for he stretched himself out as far as he
could, and then drew himself up in a bunch, as
if he were going to sleep.</p>

<p>"I wish he wouldn't do that," thought Kate,
anxiously. "I don't want to shoot him in his
sleep."</p>

<p>But Bunny was not asleep. He was thinking.
He was trying to make up his mind about something.
There was no way of finding out what it
was that he was trying to make up his mind
about. He might have been wondering why
some plants did not grow with their roots uppermost,
so that he could get at them without rubbing
his little nose in the dirt; or why trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
were not good to eat right through trunk and
all. Or he might have been trying to determine
whether it would be better for him to go over to
'Lijah Ford's garden, and try to get a bite at
some cabbage-leaves; or to run down to the field
just outside of the woods, where he would very
likely meet a certain little girl rabbit that he
knew very well.</p>

<p>But whatever it was, he had no sooner made
up his mind about it than he gave one big hop
and was out of sight in a minute.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Kate. "He's gone!"</p>

<p>"I reckon he thought he'd guv you 'bout
chance enough, Miss Kate," said a voice behind
her, and turning hurriedly, she saw Uncle Braddock.</p>

<p>"Why, how did you come here?" she exclaimed.
"I didn't hear you."</p>

<p>"Reckon not, Miss Kate," said the old man.
"You don't s'pose I was a-goin' to frighten
away yer game. I seed you a-stoopin' down
aimin' at somethin', and I jist creeped along
a little at a time to see what it was. Why, what
<i>did</i> come over you, Miss Kate, to let that ole har
go? It was the puttiest shot I ever did see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! I couldn't fire at the dear little thing
while it was eating so prettily," said Kate, letting
down the hammer of the gun as easily as she
could; "and then he cut up such funny little
capers that I came near laughing right out. I
couldn't shoot him while he was so happy, and
I'm glad I didn't do it at all."</p>

<p>"All right, Miss Kate," said Uncle Braddock,
as he started off on his way through the woods;
"that may be a werry pious way to go a-huntin'
but it won't bring you in much meat."</p>

<p>When Harry came back from hunting for the
bee-tree, which he did not find, he saw Kate
walking slowly down the path toward the village,
the gun under her arm, with the muzzle carefully
pointed toward the ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">A Man in a Boat.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>On a very pleasant afternoon that fall, a man
came down Crooked Creek in a small flat-bottomed
boat. He rowed leisurely, as if he
had been rowing a long distance and felt a little
tired. In one end of the boat was a small trunk.</p>

<p>As this man, who had red hair, and a red face,
and large red hands, pulled slowly along the
creek, turning his head every now and then to
see where he was going, he gradually approached
the bridge that crossed the creek near "One-eyed
Lewston's" cabin. Just before he reached
the bridge, he noticed what seemed to him a
curious shadow running in a thin straight line
across the water. Resting on his oars, and looking
up to see what there was above him to throw
such a shadow, he perceived a telegraph wire
stretching over the creek, and losing itself to
sight in the woods on each side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>A telegraph wire was an ordinary sight to
this man, but this particular wire seemed to astonish
him greatly.</p>

<p>"What on earth is this?" he asked out loud.
But there was no one to answer him, and so,
after puzzling his mind for a few minutes, he
rowed on.</p>

<p>When that man reached the point in the
creek to which he was bound, and, with his trunk
on his shoulder, walked up to the house where
he used to live, he was still more astonished;
for a telegraph wire ran through one corner of
the back yard.</p>

<p>Cousin Maria now lived in this house, and
George Mason was coming to pay her a visit.
His appearance was rather a surprise to her, but
still she welcomed him. She was a good soul.</p>

<p>Almost before he asked her how she was, he
put the question to her:</p>

<p>"What telegraph line's that?"</p>

<p>So Cousin Maria wiped her hands on her
long gingham apron (she had been washing her
best set of china), and she sat down and told
him all about it.</p>

<p>"You see, George," said she, "that there line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was the boys' telegraph line, afore they sold it to
the mica people; and when the boys put it up
they expected to make a heap of money, which
I reckon they didn't do, or else they wouldn't
have sold it. But these mica people wanted it,
and they lengthened it at both ends, and bought
it of the boys&mdash;or rather of Harry Loudon, for he
was the smartest of the lot, and the real owner
of the thing&mdash;he and his sister Kate&mdash;as far as I
could see. And when they stretched the line
over to Hetertown, they came to me and told
me how the line ran along the road most of the
way, but that they could save a lot of time and
money (though I don't see how they could save
much of a lot of money when, accordin' to all
accounts, the whole line didn't cost much, bein'
just fastened to pine-trees, trimmed off, and if
it had cost much, them boys couldn't have built
it, for I reckon the mica people didn't help 'em
a great deal, after all) if I would let them cut
across my grounds with their wire, and I hadn't
no objection, anyway, for the line didn't do no
harm up there in the air, and so I said certainly
they might, and they did, and there it is."</p>

<p>When George Mason heard all this, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
walked out of the back-door and over to the
wood-pile, where he got an axe and cut down
the pole that was in Cousin Maria's back yard.
And when the pole fell, it broke the wire, just as
Mr. Martin had got to the sixth word of a message
he was sending over to Hetertown.</p>

<p>Cousin Maria was outraged.</p>

<p>"George Mason!" said she, "you can stay
here as long as you like, and you can have part
of whatever I've got in the house to eat, but I'll
never sit down to the table with you till you've
mended that wire and nailed it to another pole."</p>

<p>"All right," answered George Mason.
"Then I'll eat alone."</p>

<p>When Mr. Martin and the mica-mine people
and the Akeville people and Harry and Kate
and all the boys and everybody black and white
heard what had happened, there was great excitement.
It was generally agreed that something
must be done with George Mason. He
had no more right to cut down that pole because
he had once lived on the place, than he had to
go and cut down any of the neighbors' beanpoles.</p>

<p>So the sheriff and some deputy sheriffs, (Tony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Kirk among them), and a constable and a number
of volunteer constables, went off after George
Mason, to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>It was more than a week before they found
him, and it is probable that they would not
have captured him at all, had he not persisted in
staying in the neighborhood, so as to be on
hand with his axe, in case the line should be
repaired.</p>

<p>"It's all along of my tellin' him that that
line was got up by them Loudon children," said
Cousin Maria. "He hates Mr. Loudon worse
than pisen, because he was the man that found
out all his tricks."</p>

<p>Mason was taken to the court-house and
locked up in the jail. Almost all the people of
the county, and some people belonging to adjoining
counties, made up their minds to be at
the court-house when his trial should take place.</p>

<p>On the second night of his imprisonment,
George Mason forced open a window of his cell
and went away. And what was more, he staid
away. He had no desire to be at the court-house
when his trial took place.</p>

<p>No one felt more profound satisfaction when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
George Mason left the country, and the telegraph
line was once more in working order, than
Harry and Kate.</p>

<p>They had an idea that if George Mason,
should persist in cutting the telegraph line, the
Mica Company would give it up, and that they
might be called upon to refund the money on
which Aunt Matilda depended for support.
They had been told that they need not trouble
themselves about this, as the Mica Company
had taken all risks; but still they were delighted
when they heard that George Mason had cleared
out, and that there was every reason to suppose
that he would not come back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Aunt Matilda's Letter.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>One afternoon, about the end of October,
Aunt Matilda was sitting in her big
straight-backed chair, on one side of her fireplace.
There was a wood fire blazing on the
hearth, for the days were getting cool and the
old woman liked to be warm. On the other
side of the fireplace sat Uncle Braddock. Sitting
on the floor, between the two, were John William
Webster and Dick Ford. In the doorway
stood Gregory Montague. He was not on very
good terms with Aunt Matilda, and was rather
afraid to come in all the way. On the bed sat
Aunt Judy.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Aunt Matilda
was giving a party. Nothing of the kind.
These colored people were not very much engrossed
with business at this time of the year,
and as it was not far from supper-time, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
they all happened to be near Aunt Matilda's
cabin that afternoon, they thought they'd step
in and see her.</p>

<p>"Does any of you uns know," asked Aunt
Matilda, "whar Ole Miles is now? Dey tells
me he don't carry de mails no more."</p>

<p>"No," said John William Webster, who was
always quick to speak. "Dey done stop dat ar.
Dey got so many letters up dar at de mica mines,
dat dey send all the big ones to de pos'-office in
a bag an' a buggy, and dey send de little ones
ober de telegraph."</p>

<p>"But whar's Ole Miles?" repeated Aunt
Matilda.</p>

<p>"He's a-doin' jobs up aroun' de mines," said
Uncle Braddock. "De las' time I see him he
was a-whitewashin' a fence."</p>

<p>"Well, I wants to see Ole Miles," said Aunt
Matilda. "I wants him to carry a letter fur
me."</p>

<p>"I'll carry yer letter, Aunt Matilda," said Dick
Ford; and Gregory Montague, anxious to curry
favor, as it was rapidly growing near to ash-cake
time, stated in a loud voice that he'd take it
"fus thing in de mornin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don' want none o' you uns," said Aunt Matilda.
"Ole Miles is used to carryin' letters, and
I wants him to carry my letter. Ef you'd like
ter keep yerse'f out o' mischief, you Greg'ry, you
kin go 'long and tell him I wants him to carry a
letter fur me."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," said Gregory, "fus' thing in de
mornin'."</p>

<p>"Better go 'long now," said Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>"Too late now, Aunt Matilda," said Gregory,
anxiously. "Couldn't git dar 'fore dark, no
how, and he'd be gone away, and I 'spect I
couldn't fin' him."</p>

<p>"Whar is yer letter?" asked Uncle Braddock.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tain't writ yit," said Aunt Matilda. "I
wants some o' you uns to write it fur me. Kin
any o' you youngsters write writin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said John William Webster.
"Greg'ry kin write fus-rate. He's been ter
school mor'n a month."</p>

<p>"You shet up!" cried Gregory, indignantly.
"Ise been to school mor'n dat. Ise been free
or four weeks. And I know'd how to write
some 'fore I went. Mah'sr George teached me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better git Miss Kate to write yer
letter," said Aunt Judy. "She'd spell it out a
great sight better dan Gregory Montague, I
reckons."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want Miss Kate to write dis
hyar letter. She does enough, let alone writin'
letters fur me. Come 'long hyar, you Greg'ry.
Reach up dar on dat shelf and git dat piece o'
paper behin' de 'lasses gourd."</p>

<p>Gregory obeyed promptly, and pulled out a
half-sheet of note-paper from behind the gourd.
The paper had been there a good while, and was
rather yellow-looking. There was also a drop
of molasses on one corner of it, which John
William said would do to seal it up with; but
Gregory wiped it carefully off on the leg of his
trousers.</p>

<p>"Now, den," said Aunt Matilda; "sot yerse'f
right down dar on de floor. Git off dat ar
smooth board, you Dick, an' let Greg'ry put his
paper dar. I hain't got no pen, but hyar's a
pencil Miss Kate lef' one day. But it ain't got
no pint. Ef some of you boys has got a knife,
ye kin put a pint to it."</p>

<p>Uncle Braddock dived into the recesses of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
dressing-gown, and produced a great jack-knife,
with a crooked iron blade and a hickory handle.</p>

<p>"Look a-dar!" cried John William Webster.
"Uncle Braddock's a-gwine ter chop de pencil
up fur kindlin'-wood."</p>

<p>"None o' yer laughin' at dis knife," said
Uncle Braddock, with a frown. "I done made
dis hyar knife mese'f."</p>

<p>A better knife, however, was produced by
Dick Ford, and the pencil was sharpened. Then
Gregory Montague stretched himself out on the
floor, resting on his elbows, with the paper before
him and the pencil in his hand.</p>

<p>"Is you ready?" said Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>"All right," said Gregory. "Yer can go
'long."</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda put her elbows on her knees
and her chin in her hands, and looked into the
fire. Gregory and every one else waited quite
a while for her to begin.</p>

<p>"Ye had better put de number ob de year
fus," suggested Uncle Braddock.</p>

<p>"Well, ye kin put dat," said Aunt Matilda,
"while I'm a-workin' out de letter in my mind."</p>

<p>There now arose a discussion as to what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the "number of the year." Aunt Judy knew
that the "war" was somewhere along in "sixty,"
and thought it must certainly be seventy or
eighty by this time; while Uncle Braddock, who
was accustomed to look back a long way, was
sure it was "nigh on to a hun'red."</p>

<p>Dick Ford, however, although he was not a
writer, could read, and had quite a fancy for
spelling out a newspaper, and he asserted that
the year was eighteen hundred and seventy, and
so it was put down "180070," much to the disgust
of Uncle Braddock, who did not believe it
was so much.</p>

<p>"Yer ought to say ef it's before Christ or
after Christ," said Aunt Judy. "Old Mah'sr
Truly Mathers 'splained dat to me, 'bout years."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Gregory, ready with his
pencil, "which is it?"</p>

<p>Dick Ford happened to know a little on the
subject, and so he told Gregory how he should
put down "B. C." for "before Christ," and
"A. C." for "after Christ," and that "A. C."
was right for this year.</p>

<p>This was set down in Gregory's most careful
lettering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dat dar hind letter's got the stumic-ache,"
said John William Webster, putting his long
finger, black on top and yellow underneath, on
the C, which was rather doubled up.</p>

<p>Nobody thought of the month or the day,
and so the letter was considered dated.</p>

<p>"Now, den," said Gregory, "who's it to?"</p>

<p>"Jist never you mind who's it to," answered
Aunt Matilda. "I know, an' that's enough to
know."</p>

<p>"But you've got to put de name on de
back," said Aunt Judy, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Dat's so," said Uncle Braddock, with equal
anxiety.</p>

<p>"No, I hain't," remarked Aunt Matilda.
"I'll tell Ole Miles who to take it to. Put down
for de fus' thing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Ise been thinkin' fur a long time dat I oughter to write about
dis hyar matter, and I s'pose you is the right one to write to.'"</p></div>

<p>"What matter's dat?" asked Aunt Judy.</p>

<p>"Neber you mind," replied Aunt Matilda.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully, Gregory printed this
sentence, with Dick Ford close on one side of
him; with John William's round, woolly head
stuck almost under his chin; with Uncle Braddock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
leaning over him from his chair; and
Aunt Judy standing, peering down upon him
from behind.</p>

<p>"Dat's wrong," said Dick Ford, noticing
that Gregory had written the last words thus:
"rite 1 ter rite 2." "She don't want no figgers."</p>

<p>"What did she say 'em fur, den?" asked
Gregory.</p>

<p>"Now, Greg'ry," said Aunt Matilda, "put
down dis:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'I don't want to make no trouble, and I wouldn't do nothin'
to trouble dem chillen; but Ise been a-waitin' a good long
while now, and I been thinkin' I'd better write an' see 'bout it.'"</p></div>

<p>"What you want to see 'bout?" asked
Aunt Judy, quickly.</p>

<p>"Neber you min' what it is," replied Aunt
Matilda. "Go on, you Greg'ry, and put down:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Dat money o' mine was reel money, and when I put it in,
I thought I'd git it back ag'in afore dis.'"</p></div>

<p>"How much was it, Aunt Matilda?" asked
Uncle Braddock, while Aunt Judy opened her
eyes and her mouth, simply because she could
not open her ears any wider than they were.</p>

<p>"Dat's none o' your business," replied Aunt
Matilda. "Now put down:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'I 'spect dem telegram fixin's cost a lot o' money, but I don't
'spect it's jist right to take all an ole woman's money to build
'em.'"</p></div>

<p>"Lor's <i>ee</i>!" ejaculated Uncle Braddock,
"dat's so!"</p>

<p>"Now you Greg'ry," continued Aunt Matilda,
"put down:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Ef you write me a letter 'bout dat ar money, you kin giv it to Ole
Miles.'</p></div>

<p>Now sign my name to dat ar letter."</p>

<p>The next day, having been summoned by
the obliging Gregory, Old Miles made his appearance
in Aunt Matilda's cabin.</p>

<p>The old woman explained to him that the
letter was so important that she could trust it to
no one who was not accustomed to carry letters,
and Miles was willing and proud to exercise his
skill for her benefit.</p>

<p>"Now, den," said she; "take dis hyar letter
to de man what works de telegrum in Hetertown,
and fotch me back an answer."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2><h3><span class="smcap">Time to Stop.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>About a week after this letter was written,
Kate said to Harry:</p>

<p>"You really ought to have Aunt Matilda's
roof mended. There are several holes in it. I
think her house ought to be made tight and
warm before winter; don't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Harry. "I'll get some
shingles and nail them over the holes to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and a rainy day.
About ten o'clock Harry went to Aunt Matilda's
cabin with his shingles and a hammer and nails.
Kate walked over with him.</p>

<p>To their surprise they found the old woman
in bed.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter, Aunt Matilda?"
asked Kate. "Are you sick?"</p>

<p>"No, honey, I isn't sick," said the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
woman; "but somehow or other I don't keer to
git up. Ise mighty comfurt'ble jist as I is."</p>

<p>"But you ought to have your breakfast," said
Kate. "What is this basin of water doing on
the foot of your bed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't 'sturb dat ar tin basin," said
Aunt Matilda. "Dat's to ketch der rain. Dar's
a hole right ober de foot o' de bed."</p>

<p>"But you won't want that now," said Kate.
"Harry's going to nail shingles over all the holes
in your roof."</p>

<p>"An' fall down an' break his neck. He
needn't do no sich foolishness. Dat ar tin
basin's did me fur years in and years out, and I
neber kicked it ober yit. Dere's no use a-mendin'
holes dis time o' day."</p>

<p>"It's a very good time of day," said Harry,
who was standing in the door; "and it isn't
raining now. You used to have a ladder here,
Aunt Matilda. If you'll tell me where it is, I
can mend that hole over your bed without getting
on the roof at all."</p>

<p>"Jist you keep away from de roof," said the
old woman. "Ef you go hammerin' on dat ole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
roof you'll have it all down on me head. I don't
want no mendin' dis time o' day."</p>

<p>Finding that Aunt Matilda was so much opposed
to any carpenter-work on her premises at
that time, Harry went home, while Kate remained
to get the old woman some breakfast.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda felt better that afternoon, and
she sat up and ate her supper with Uncle Braddock
(who happened to be there); but as she
was evidently feeling the effects of her great age,
an arrangement was made, by which Aunt Judy
gave up her cabin and came to live with Aunt
Matilda and take care of her.</p>

<p>One morning, about a week after the rainy
Saturday, Mrs. Loudon came over to see Aunt
Matilda. She found the old woman lying on
the bed, and evidently worried about something.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Mary," said Aunt Matilda,
"Ise kind o' disturbed in me min'. I rit a letter
a long time ago, and Ole Miles ain't fetched me
no answer yit, and it sorter worries me."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you could write," said Mrs.
Loudon, somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>"Neither I kin," said Aunt Matilda. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
jist got dat Greg'ry Montague to write it fur
me, and dear knows what he put in it."</p>

<p>"Who was your letter to, Aunt Matilda?"
asked Mrs. Loudon.</p>

<p>"I do' know his name, but he works de telegrum
at Hetertown. An' I do' min' tellin' you
'bout it, Miss Mary, ef you do' worry dem
chillen. De letter was 'bout my money in de
telegrum comp'ny. Dat was reel silber money,
an' I hain't heerd nor seed nothin' of it sence."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Loudon went home she told
Harry and Kate of Aunt Matilda's troubles.</p>

<p>Neither of them said anything at the time,
but Harry put on his hat and went up to the
store, while Kate sat down to her sewing.</p>

<p>After a while, she said:</p>

<p>"I think, mother, it's pretty hard in Aunt
Matilda, after all we've done for her, to think of
nothing but the ten cents she put into the stock
of the company."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly natural," said Mrs. Loudon.
"That ten cents was her own private property,
and no matter how small a private property may
be, it is of greater interest to the owner than
any other property in the world. To be sure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the money that was paid for the telegraph line
is for Aunt Matilda's benefit, but you and Harry
have the management and the spending of it.
But that ten cents was all her own, and she
could spend it just as she chose."</p>

<p>The next day Kate went over to Aunt Matilda
with two silver ten-cent pieces that Harry
had got from Mr. Darby.</p>

<p>"Aunt Matilda," said she, "this is not the
very same ten-cent piece you put into the company,
but it's just as good; and Harry thinks
that you have about doubled your money, and so
here's another one."</p>

<p>The old woman, who was sitting alone by
the fire wrapped up in a shawl, took the money,
and putting it in the hollow of her bony hand,
gazed at it with delight.</p>

<p>Then she looked up at Kate.</p>

<p>"You is good chillen," she said. "You is
mighty good chillen. I don't 'spect I'll lib much
longer in dis hyar world. Ise so precious old
dat it's 'bout time to stop. But I don't 'spects
I'll find nobody in heben that'll be more reel
comfort to me dan you chillen."</p>

<p>"Oh Aunt Matilda!" cried Kate. "Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
you'll meet all your friends and relations that
you talk so much about and who died so long
ago."</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Matilda, very deliberately,
"perhaps I shall, and perhaps I sha'n't; dere's
no tellin'. But dere ain't no mistakin' 'bout
you chillen."</p>

<p>That afternoon, when Uncle Braddock called,
Aunt Matilda said to him:</p>

<p>"Ef you see Ole Miles ye kin tell him he
needn't bring me no answer to dat letter."</p>

<p>Very early one morning, a few days after this,
Kate went over to Aunt Matilda's cabin.</p>

<p>She saw Aunt Judy standing at the door.</p>

<p>"How's Aunt Matilda?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Gone to glory," said Aunt Judy.</p>

<p>Aunt Matilda was buried under a birch-tree
near the church that she used to attend when
able to walk.</p>

<p>That portion of her "fund" which remained
unexpended at the time of her death was used
to pay her funeral expenses and to erect a suitable

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
